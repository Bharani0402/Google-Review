2025-12-22 12:37:44.562957,"The Eiffel Tower is honestly better in real life than in photos. You think you’ve seen it enough already, but standing there still feels impressive. It’s huge, but somehow not heavy or overwhelming.

The area around it is relaxed. People sit around, talk, take photos, or just chill on the grass. Walking around the tower is nice because every angle looks a bit different, so you don’t feel rushed to leave after one picture.

I went close to sunset and that was the best choice. The view from above is simple but beautiful — rooftops, long streets, and the city stretching out in every direction. Nothing fancy, just very Paris.

At night, when the tower starts sparkling, it hits differently. It’s crowded, yes, but for a few minutes everyone just stops and looks. That moment alone makes the visit worth it.

Not a hidden gem, not a quiet place, but still something you should see at least once.",5.0,positive,ambience,L A K
2025-11-13 12:37:44.563408,"•	No ticket needed: You don’t have to buy a ticket to enter the tower or queue for elevators—just pick a great external vantage and you’re free to shoot at your own pace.
•	Excellent photo spots nearby: Many well-documented locations give iconic Tower views from outside—e.g., Rue de l’Université, Rue de Buenos‑Aires, Avenue de Camoëns. These spots are highlighted in photographer guides as “hidden” or less-crowded alternatives.  ￼
•	Flexible timing: Because you’re not tied to a ticket time, you can go early morning, late evening, or at twilight to capture different lighting and mood.
•	Lower cost: Skipping entrance means saving time and money, and focusing instead on the view and atmosphere.
•	Great for casual or photographic visits: If your priority is the Tower in your photo, rather than ascending it, this approach works perfectly.

⸻

⚠️ What to keep in mind
•	You miss the “inside” experience: You won’t go up into the tower, see its internal architecture, or get panoramic views from heights—it’s purely an “outside vantage” experience.
•	Crowds/lines possible at popular spots: Even external photo spots can be crowded (especially the very popular ones like Trocadéro or Rue de l’Université). Some guides warn of “many people” even at street viewpoints.  ￼
•	Lighting & viewpoint selection matter: Good photos depend heavily on time of day, weather, background composition (street, river, buildings). If you go at the wrong time you may get harsh light or less dramatic angle.
•	Expect standard viewpoint, not “secret”: Many external spots now appear in photo-spot guides and social media; so while you’re not entering the tower, you might share the view with others.
•	Still some cost/time: If you go out for the trip, you’ll still invest time (walking, transport) to reach a good baseline vantage.",5.0,positive,pricing,Amrit Das

You can see all of Paris laid out beneath you, which really gives you a sense of how beautiful the city is.

The area around the tower felt very clean, safe, and well organized. We had heard stories in the past about street sellers and pickpocketing, but during our visit, everything seemed to be well controlled with a strong police presence.

I visited the Eiffel Tower today and it absolutely lived up to the hype. From the moment I stepped onto the Champ de Mars, the Iron Lady’s latticework felt both grand and surprisingly graceful. The views from the top are breathtaking—Paris stretches out in every direction like a living postcard, with the Seine curving through the city and landmarks popping up everywhere you look.

The experience felt smooth and well-organized. Staff were friendly, and even with the crowds, the lines moved faster than I expected. I loved taking my time on each level—there’s something special about pausing with a coffee and just soaking in the panorama. As evening fell, the tower’s sparkle made the whole scene feel downright romantic and cinematic.

If you’re planning a visit, I’d recommend booking tickets ahead of time and going a bit before sunset so you catch daylight, golden hour, and the first twinkle after dark. Whether you take the elevator or brave the stairs, the journey itself is part of the fun.

We arrived via the hop-on hop-off bus, and things felt quite manageable and not as bad as people often say.

We boarded a ferry along the Seine River, which was a lovely way to see the Eiffel Tower and nearby buildings.

The boat had an audio guide explaining the landmarks we passed, which made the ride both relaxing and informative.

One of the most heartwarming moments was seeing people along the river waving at us…. it felt very warm and welcoming.

The kids especially enjoyed the sparkling “blink blink” lights on the tower that shine every 5 minutes each hour.

Unfortunately, the weather was foggy, so we could only see about half of the tower, which was a bit disappointing.

Still, even with limited visibility, the experience was memorable and special in its own way.

The wait for the 1st lift was about 15 min from timed entry, the wait for the 2nd was over 30 min and it may get very windy on the open platform. I would plan for at least an hour on top, there are 2 levels on top, one enclosed and heated and it offers an amazing view from the open platform. Very rewarding to watch city dressing in the lights.
Now, i found it best to buy tix 60 days in advance from official site, but it may be close to impossible to do outside of same time zone.

The Eiffel Tower is truly a breathtaking historical landmark. I’m still amazed that such a grand project was built back in 1889 and has been preserved so well to this day. As a historical monument, it’s nothing less than a masterpiece.

That said, I’d strongly recommend visiting in autumn or spring. We went in the summer, and the crowds were overwhelming – it makes the whole experience less enjoyable.

We didn’t go up the tower itself, as all our friends who had visited before advised us against it. They said it wasn’t worth the long queues and the ticket price. Honestly, we enjoyed the tower much more from the outside and from other viewpoints in the city.

Another downside is the aggressive street vendors around the tower. Every few steps you hear “buy this, buy that” — keychains, water bottles, T-shirts, photos. Honestly, it takes away from the magic of the place.

2025-12-22 12:37:44.564299,"Eiffel Tower, a wrought - iron structure located in Paris is a technological masterpiece in building histories.
It was designed and built during 1887 by Gustave Eiffel and then was named in his honor too.

Having a height of 1,083 feet, a  weight of 10,000 tons and revited by 2.5 million rivets, this wondrous scape became the entrance gateway to the International exposition in 1889.
It was erected in two years, with a small labor force and at a low cost.  Designed as a well lit, airy, strong structure, which pioneered a revolution in civil engineering.

It remarkably stands on four lattice girder piers. The glass cage machines were designed by the US Otis Elevator Company, which later became the main feature of the building.

Though, Modifications were made for further international expositions of 1900, 1925, and 1937 but Additions to the tower were made for television transmissions only wherein 66 feet were added to it's height.

The tower features a museum (which we were unable to see), restaurants, and a much talked about Eiffel’s Reception Room providing space for business conferences, cultural events, and social gatherings.
An observation deck is located just under the antenna, at 906 feet.

Proud to have actually been there to see it, feel the awesome greatness of this incredible fascinating structure and partaking a great view of the city.

We chose to go in the evening, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. As the sun began to set, the atmosphere around the Eiffel Tower became magical. The tower looked stunning against the glowing sky, and when it started to sparkle for 5 minutes at the beginning of each hour, it felt like the whole crowd paused to admire it. Watching those golden lights twinkle was a sight that truly gave us goosebumps.

Built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle by engineer Gustave Eiffel, it was originally meant to be a temporary structure. Today, it stands as a global symbol of Paris and is one of the most visited monuments on earth.

I booked tickets online to reach the top floor of the Eiffel Tower. Online booking is the only way to get tickets, and it is highly in demand on both weekdays and weekends. It is important to book in advance and arrive on time.

After entering the premises, there is a security check to pass through. Depending on your ticket type, you can take the elevator or stairs to reach the second floor. From there, you get a beautiful view of the Paris skyline. If you have tickets for the top floor, you can continue by elevator or stairs to reach the summit.

There are no strict time limits once you reach the top. The top floor usually closes around 6 p.m. I recommend visiting close to sunset to enjoy the stunning views and unforgettable atmosphere.

If you are visiting Paris even once in your lifetime, this is a must see. I strongly suggest going to the top floor without worrying too much about the extra cost. It is absolutely worth it for the incredible experience.

You can go into the grounds for free but will need to go through security, and it will cost you to go up the Tower itself - but it is so very worth it.  You have the option to go halfway up or you can pay a little extra and go all the way to the very top, although expect to wait in line a while as the lifts to the very top are quite small and the queues are long.
Once you are at the top it's clear to see it was worth it. There are both indoor and outdoor viewing points, a very small champagne shop, and (thankfully) a toilet.

I visited in the late afternoon, and it was the perfect time. Watching the sunset over Paris from the top was magical the whole city slowly lit up as the golden light faded, and then suddenly, the tower began to sparkle with thousands of twinkling lights. The atmosphere was filled with excitement; people were cheering, taking photos, and simply admiring the view in silence.

The view from the top is something I’ll never forget.

The lift ride itself was smooth, and everything was well-organized. The staff were polite and helpful, guiding visitors kindly even though it was quite crowded.

There are small cafés and souvenir shops inside where you can grab a coffee or a light snack, which makes the experience even better. I also loved walking around Champs de Mars Park afterward it’s one of the best spots to take photos of the tower, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour.

2025-12-22 12:37:44.564545,"The Eiffel Tower did not disappoint. Grab a beret and a baguette and look closer than the postcards. From far away, the tower seems light and decorative, but up close it feels strong and precise. The iron “lace” is not decoration. It is the structure itself. Every curve and crisscross helps the tower stand tall against gravity and wind.

Gustave Eiffel designed the tower with wind in mind. As the tower rises, it becomes narrower because strong winds hit higher levels with more force. The curved shape lets wind pass around it instead of pushing straight against it. This design choice is why the tower has survived storms for more than a hundred years.

One of the most interesting features is that nothing is hidden. The iron beams, joints, and rivets are all visible. Over 18,000 iron pieces are held together by millions of rivets, allowing the tower to expand and contract as temperatures change. Even the elevators follow the curve of the legs instead of moving straight up. The Eiffel Tower proves that smart engineering can be beautiful without trying to be fancy.",5.0,neutral,,Andrew Peluso

Be absolutely sure what type of ticket your purchasing and make sure you're buying the ticket from the official website.  Double check the ticket is for 1st, 2nd or Top floor access.  Don't walk up the stairs to the 2nd floor unless you're in good shape for 600+ outdoor stairs.  (Even walking down the stairs is taxing on the legs.)  We noticed the elevators were always completely filled, so watch your belongings and children.  There's limited seating under and around the Tower and very limited rain/weather cover so bring a jacket if the weather is a concern.  Also, the temperatures and wind on the top will be different from ground level.  Expect it to be cooler and windy.  And definitely use the restroom before you go up the Tower.

Instead of focusing only on going up the tower, we spent most of our time enjoying the surrounding area, and that turned out to be the best part for our family. Walking around the Champ de Mars and the nearby paths gave us so many beautiful angles of the tower without feeling rushed. We took our time, paused often for family photos, and just enjoyed the moment — watching the tower rise above the city while the Paris life moved around us.

The vibe on a weekday is also different: fewer tour groups, less noise, and it feels more like you’re seeing the Eiffel Tower as part of everyday Paris rather than a crowded tourist rush. We strolled, admired the views, and enjoyed the fresh air and the scenery, which made it feel like a proper Paris memory rather than a quick checklist stop.

The experience is what you make it. You can simply admire its intricate ironwork from the Champ de Mars gardens with a picnic (a fantastic free option), or you can ascend to the top for breathtaking, unparalleled views of Paris.

Here’s what to expect:

· The Views: Absolutely spectacular. Seeing the city layout from above, with the River Seine winding through the streets and monuments like the Arc de Triomphe and Sacré-Cœur in the distance, is unforgettable. The second level offers the best balance for photos. The very top is a unique, thrilling experience, though the views are naturally more panoramic than detailed.
· The Structure: Being on the tower itself is awe-inspiring. Looking down through the glass floors or just feeling the scale of the ironwork up close is incredible.
· The Atmosphere: There's a palpable buzz of excitement from visitors from all over the world. It's especially magical at night when the tower sparkles for five minutes on the hour, every hour.

A few tips for a better visit:

· BOOK TICKETS ONLINE IN ADVANCE! This is the most important advice. Queues for tickets can be hours long. Pre-booking a timed slot saves an immense amount of time and stress.
· Consider the stairs. If you're able, taking the stairs to the second floor is often faster, cheaper, and offers a unique, up-close perspective of the structure.
· Go at different times: Sunset is a popular time for a reason – you get to see the city in daylight, at golden hour, and then lit up at night. But early morning can be less crowded.
· Security check: There is a security check to enter the plaza, so expect a queue even with pre-booked tickets.

An essential Parisian experience. It’s busy, it's touristy, but it's also magnificent and unforgettable. Plan ahead, be patient, and prepare to be amazed.

The scale and engineering are phenomenal, and the views from the platforms are spectacular.

The area around the tower is just as charming. Classic Parisian buildings, broad promenades and the manicured lawns of the Champ de Mars give the whole spot a timeless, romantic feel. From the elegant Haussmann-era façades nearby to the vista across the Seine toward Trocadéro, the surrounding architecture makes wandering the neighborhood a joy — perfect for photos, relaxed strolls, and soaking in Parisian atmosphere.

It’s also a very popular place, so expect big crowds; people from all over the world gather here to admire the monument and take in the scenery. Because of that volume of visitors, be mindful of your belongings. Pickpockets operate in crowded tourist spots, and there are street hustles and game scammers who may try to distract you or pressure you into playing quick “games” that aren’t fair. Keep bags zipped and close, avoid carrying valuables in easily accessible pockets, and politely decline invitations from anyone hawking games or insisting you join impromptu activities.

📸 Why You Don’t Need a Ticket

No ticket or queues: You can skip the long lines and elevator waits — just find a great vantage point and shoot freely at your own pace.

Famous external photo spots: Excellent views from nearby streets include Rue de l’Université, Rue de Buenos-Aires, and Avenue de Camoëns — all well-loved by professional photographers and Instagram travelers.

Flexible timing: Without a set ticket time, you can visit at sunrise, golden hour, twilight, or late night to capture the Tower under different moods and lighting.

Budget-friendly: You save both money and time, focusing purely on the atmosphere and the view.

Perfect for casual visitors or photographers: If your goal is the Eiffel Tower in your frame, not from its top, this approach is ideal.

---

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

No interior access: You’ll miss the inside structure and the panoramic city views from the top — this experience is purely from the outside.

Crowds at popular spots: Iconic areas like Trocadéro and Rue de l’Université can get crowded, especially at sunset, so patience helps.

Lighting is key: For the best shots, plan your timing — morning light offers soft tones, while sunset provides warm golden hues.

Not entirely “secret”: Many of these locations now appear in travel guides and social media, so expect other photographers too.

Plan some time: You’ll still spend time walking or taking transport to reach the best angles, so schedule accordingly.

As a must-visit, it offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city from its three levels—first at 57m, second at 115m, and summit at 276m. The experience is magical, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour until 1am.
History buffs will love knowing it was designed by Gustave Eiffel and features a secret apartment at the top. For visitors, book tickets online up to 60 days in advance to skip long queues—summit access via elevator costs €35.30 for adults in 2025, €17.70 for youth (12-24), and €8.90 for kids (4-11), with free entry under 4. Opening hours are typically 9:30am to 11:45pm, extending to midnight in summer; last entry 45 minutes before closing.
Arrive early to avoid crowds, and consider the stairs for a cheaper option (€14.20 to second floor for adults). The second floor has shops, restrooms, and the best views without needing the summit. Security checks are thorough, so pack light. Nearby, enjoy the Champ de Mars gardens for picnics or photos.

Watching the city from up there was one of the best experiences of my trip — truly unforgettable!",5.0,positive,ambience,Martina Miklošić

I would also recommend buying tickets in advance, we came in October around the slower season and the line for buying tickets was so long. Definitely glad to have bought the tickets in advance!",5.0,positive,service,Abby Latham
2025-09-14 12:37:44.565086,"Great experience. Ordered tickets in advance for night time, elevator second floor. And purchased on site for Elevator top (we came to see sunrise near the tower, which was totally worth it. Then lowly walked towards the line up entrance, and were almost the first).
Best experience - day time. Getting up to the top worth it.
Night time - great to see how it glows.

Unless you are ready to wake up very early, recommending to buy tickets in advance.",5.0,positive,service,Anna Kuksenko

An absolute must-see in Paris and even more impressive in person than in photos. The structure is massive, with incredible views from every level. Going up at sunset is highly recommended as you can watch the city light up while still seeing it in daylight. The tower sparkles every hour at night, which is a highlight of the visit and creates a great atmosphere along the Seine. Security and entry lines are well-organized, though still busy, so booking tickets in advance saves time. The surrounding Champ de Mars park is clean, spacious, and perfect for photos or a picnic. A world-class landmark that fully lives up to its reputation.",5.0,positive,"cleanliness, ambience",Kareem A
2025-11-13 12:37:44.565104,"The Eiffel Tower is as beautiful as always! The new security fence around it feels a bit sad — I still remember when you could freely stroll from Trocadéro all the way to Les Invalides. I understand the safety concerns, but it’s a reminder of how much the world has changed. Still, it remains one of the most breathtaking places to experience in person. 🌍",4.0,positive,ambience,Margarita Shevchuk
2025-10-14 12:37:44.565109,"Absolutely fantastic experience visiting this place. We experienced it first by walking along the Seine River where the views were amazing. We decided to go to the very top off the Eiffel Tower after dusk, when the Tower was lit up, in all its glory and to experience the sparkling of the lights. Also we wanted to see all of Paris lit up from the very top - which was such a magnificent experience. The whole Eiffel Tower evening experience was awesome and it was the highlight of our time in Paris.",5.0,positive,ambience,J Youde
