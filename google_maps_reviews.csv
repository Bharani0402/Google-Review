Charlie Jameson,5.0,a month ago,"One of the most iconic experiences you can have in Paris.

Visited in November and absolutely loved it. Even though it was a busy day, the entire area around the Eiffel Tower felt surprisingly relaxed and easy to navigate. The atmosphere is magic — standing underneath the structure and looking straight up is something photos never really prepare you for. The scale is unbelievable.

I arrived early, and the queues moved quickly. Security was efficient and friendly, and the staff were helpful throughout. Once I got inside, the views from the different levels were incredible, especially from the top platform — Paris literally stretches out in every direction, with all the landmarks visible on a clear day.

At ground level, the park and riverside areas around the tower are perfect for photos. Everything is really well-maintained, and there’s plenty of space to sit, take in the view, and enjoy the moment. If you time it right, watching the tower sparkle on the hour is worth it alone.

Overall, an unforgettable visit and absolutely worth doing, no matter how many times you’ve seen it in pictures. A real must-see."
மழைத் துளி,4.0,a week ago,"The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic monuments in the world and visiting it is an unforgettable experience. From the moment you see it, the size and design are truly impressive. The structure looks stunning both during the day and at night, but the evening light show, when the tower sparkles every hour, is especially magical.

There are several viewing levels, each offering unique perspectives of Paris. The panoramic views from the top are absolutely breathtaking, allowing you to see famous landmarks like the Seine River, Sacré-Cœur, and the city’s beautiful rooftops. The elevators are well organized, and security is managed efficiently, though it can be busy, especially during peak tourist seasons.

The surrounding area is clean, spacious, and ideal for walking, picnics, and photography. Nearby cafés, souvenir shops, and river cruises make it easy to spend several hours in the area. Whether you choose to go up the tower or simply admire it from below, the Eiffel Tower delivers a memorable experience. It is a must-visit attraction for anyone traveling to Paris"
L A K,5.0,3 weeks ago,"The Eiffel Tower is honestly better in real life than in photos. You think you’ve seen it enough already, but standing there still feels impressive. It’s huge, but somehow not heavy or overwhelming.

The area around it is relaxed. People sit around, talk, take photos, or just chill on the grass. Walking around the tower is nice because every angle looks a bit different, so you don’t feel rushed to leave after one picture.

I went close to sunset and that was the best choice. The view from above is simple but beautiful — rooftops, long streets, and the city stretching out in every direction. Nothing fancy, just very Paris.

At night, when the tower starts sparkling, it hits differently. It’s crowded, yes, but for a few minutes everyone just stops and looks. That moment alone makes the visit worth it.

Not a hidden gem, not a quiet place, but still something you should see at least once."
Amrit Das,5.0,2 months ago,"•	No ticket needed: You don’t have to buy a ticket to enter the tower or queue for elevators—just pick a great external vantage and you’re free to shoot at your own pace.
•	Excellent photo spots nearby: Many well-documented locations give iconic Tower views from outside—e.g., Rue de l’Université, Rue de Buenos‑Aires, Avenue de Camoëns. These spots are highlighted in photographer guides as “hidden” or less-crowded alternatives.  ￼
•	Flexible timing: Because you’re not tied to a ticket time, you can go early morning, late evening, or at twilight to capture different lighting and mood.
•	Lower cost: Skipping entrance means saving time and money, and focusing instead on the view and atmosphere.
•	Great for casual or photographic visits: If your priority is the Tower in your photo, rather than ascending it, this approach works perfectly.

⸻

⚠️ What to keep in mind
•	You miss the “inside” experience: You won’t go up into the tower, see its internal architecture, or get panoramic views from heights—it’s purely an “outside vantage” experience.
•	Crowds/lines possible at popular spots: Even external photo spots can be crowded (especially the very popular ones like Trocadéro or Rue de l’Université). Some guides warn of “many people” even at street viewpoints.  ￼
•	Lighting & viewpoint selection matter: Good photos depend heavily on time of day, weather, background composition (street, river, buildings). If you go at the wrong time you may get harsh light or less dramatic angle.
•	Expect standard viewpoint, not “secret”: Many external spots now appear in photo-spot guides and social media; so while you’re not entering the tower, you might share the view with others.
•	Still some cost/time: If you go out for the trip, you’ll still invest time (walking, transport) to reach a good baseline vantage."
Husam Qissi,5.0,2 weeks ago,"No matter how familiar you think you are with it from photos since childhood, or how ordinary you imagine an iron structure could be, the reality will amaze you. Its lights, height, and elegant curves completely captivate you. It truly feels like one of the wonders of the world and is worth traveling to Paris just to see it."
NIKKI D,5.0,Edited 2 weeks ago,"First time ever to see this iconic French Beauty!
Absolutely magnificent!!! So romantic!!! ❤️
My Darling husband booked the tickets at sunset so we can see the tower transitioning from daylight to gorgeous sunset with champagne in adorable cone like glasses ( you can keep as souvenir).As sun began to set the whole atmosphere become magical and breathtaking.

So despite the elevator Broke on the second level, and we walked down 667 steps to get down ,I'm still going to give  5 stars!!
Why ? Because was totally worth it!!!"
Arunas Jag,5.0,2 weeks ago,"The Eiffel Tower is an absolute icon and a must-see when visiting Paris. Seeing it up close is truly impressive, whether during the day or beautifully illuminated at night. The views from the top are breathtaking, offering a stunning panorama of the city and the River Seine. Even from the ground, the atmosphere around the tower is vibrant and memorable, with great photo opportunities from every angle. A timeless landmark that perfectly captures the romance and grandeur of Paris."
Volha K,5.0,a month ago,"On our very first day in Paris, of course we went to see the Eiffel Tower — and wow, what an unforgettable moment! Seeing it in person feels magical: the size, the architecture, the atmosphere… everything was breathtaking.

It truly feels like the heart of Paris — elegant, iconic, and full of emotion.
A must-see experience that makes you realize: yes, we’re really in Paris. ✨🇫🇷"
Timothy Pang,4.0,a month ago,"Well, if one is in Paris it’s hard not to visit. Queues can be long so best to get there early and be prepared to wait for a while. Tickets are not expensive. Splendid views from the top, of course, particularly on clear days. Overall well worth a visit if one is there. Fun for all the family although small children may get bored by the wait and be less than impressed."
Bilal Qureshi,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Visited in early March and late November 2025, and the Eiffel Tower is every bit as iconic as expected. Despite the cooler weather, the experience was smooth and well organized. The views over Paris are breathtaking, especially at dusk when the city lights start coming alive. Highly recommend booking tickets in advance to avoid long queues. A must-see landmark that truly lives up to its reputation."
Vinh Ly,5.0,2 weeks ago,"My family visited the Eiffel Tower in August 2024, just after the Olympics, and it was an amazing experience. The structure itself is even more impressive in person — both elegant and powerful — and the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. You can see all of Paris laid out beneath you, which really gives you a sense of how beautiful the city is.

The area around the tower felt very clean, safe, and well organized. We had heard stories in the past about street sellers and pickpocketing, but during our visit, everything seemed to be well controlled with a strong police presence. It made the whole experience much more relaxed and enjoyable for our family.

Overall, it was one of the best parts of our trip. Whether it’s your first time in Paris or a return visit, the Eiffel Tower is truly worth it for both the history and the view."
Muhammad Abubakar,5.0,4 weeks ago,"The place does have its own charm. Expect it to be crowded and be attentive/look out for pick pockets.

Personal suggestion; visit at night time. Looks more beautiful..

If you're planning to visit the tower decks, do buy tickets well in advance."
Ezeobiakor Izuchukwu,4.0,a month ago,"🇫🇷 An Essential Paris Experience: Unforgettable Views and History!
​Visiting the Eiffel Tower was a highlight of our trip to Paris. Even on a cloudy day, the structure itself is breathtaking from the base. The sheer scale and engineering are incredible, making it a truly iconic landmark.
​The Experience: We took the time to go up to one of the platforms, which I highly recommend. The views of Paris are spectacular, giving you a completely different perspective of the city. Being inside the lattice work of the tower itself is an experience. I especially appreciated the historical information available on the different levels, detailing its construction and use for early radio transmissions. It adds so much context to this magnificent monument.
​Tips for Visitors:
​Book Tickets in Advance: Lines can be very long, so pre-booking is essential to save time.
​Allow Plenty of Time: There are security checks, queues for the lifts, and plenty of things to see once you're up there, so don't rush the experience.
​Photo Ops: The viewing platforms offer incredible spots for family photos, framed by the beautiful ironwork and the city below.
​Overall, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see landmark that lives up to its reputation. Highly recommended for all visitors to Paris!"
Behzad Yousefi,5.0,a month ago,"An unforgettable experience!
The Eiffel Tower truly lives up to its reputation. Whether you visit during the day or at sunset, the views over Paris are absolutely stunning. I recommend going around sunset so you can enjoy both the daylight view and the beautiful sparkling lights that start after dark (every hour on the hour).

The area is easy to access by metro—Trocadéro and Bir-Hakeim stations are the most convenient. From Trocadéro, you get one of the best vantage points for photos. Security checks are smooth, and the walking paths around the tower are well-organized for families and tourists.

If you want to go up, it’s best to book tickets online in advance to avoid the long lines. There are elevators for all levels, and stairs are available if you enjoy a bit of a workout. The Champ de Mars behind the tower is perfect for relaxing, taking pictures, or having a picnic.

Overall, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see landmark—beautiful, accessible, and unforgettable both during the day and at night."
steve D,5.0,Edited a month ago,I could only buy a lift access ticket online as there were no walking tickets left but when we arrived they let us walk up to the second level where you can only proceed by lift. There was a bit of queueing for the lifts but not too bad. Great views from the tower and we just happened to be there around dusk when it was then lit up.
Aryan Patel,5.0,3 months ago,"A Magical Day at the Eiffel Tower

I visited the Eiffel Tower today and it absolutely lived up to the hype. From the moment I stepped onto the Champ de Mars, the Iron Lady’s latticework felt both grand and surprisingly graceful. The views from the top are breathtaking—Paris stretches out in every direction like a living postcard, with the Seine curving through the city and landmarks popping up everywhere you look.

The experience felt smooth and well-organized. Staff were friendly, and even with the crowds, the lines moved faster than I expected. I loved taking my time on each level—there’s something special about pausing with a coffee and just soaking in the panorama. As evening fell, the tower’s sparkle made the whole scene feel downright romantic and cinematic.

If you’re planning a visit, I’d recommend booking tickets ahead of time and going a bit before sunset so you catch daylight, golden hour, and the first twinkle after dark. Whether you take the elevator or brave the stairs, the journey itself is part of the fun.

All in all, today’s visit was unforgettable. The Eiffel Tower isn’t just a must-see—it’s a must-feel. Five stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Trinity,3.0,3 weeks ago,It was a lovely experience. I didn't get to enter the tower though but I had fun touring the area and environs. Had some fun also at the park with live music and great vibes. I spent most of the day exploring and sampling street the food.
Andrew Cranwell,5.0,a month ago,"It's the place to visit when you come to Paris, worth seeing at night and in the daytime.

It's a tall climb, so be aware! You can grab a lift back down though. Just take it easy and enjoy the sprawling views of Paris.

Would really benefit from some skyline boards to help you identify the sights across Paris.

Loved the round the world height comparisons in the summit."
Mariia Udymovych,5.0,3 weeks ago,"One of the most beautiful places where I have ever been. Absolutely incredible view and place to visit. Please try to book your tickets in advance as there's a tourists and you can miss the time that suits you best. We went upstairs by stairs and it was so cool. On the way back you can use elevator. There's shops and coffee stores on the second floor, water stations, where you can get free water and lots of interesting stands regarding the building history. My big recommendation to visit."
Stephen Taylor,5.0,a month ago,"Viewing the Paris cityscape from the top of the magnificent Eiffel Tower is a MUST when visiting the City of Lights.  There are beautiful views of the glittering lights in every direction.  We were very fortunate to view from the top of the Iron Lady at night, with a full moon shining in a clear sky.  Wow!  It was magical.
Be sure to purchase your tickets well in advance!"
Chloe Brentnall,5.0,a month ago,"A beautiful day at the Eiffel Tower

I didn’t go up to the top this time, but even from the ground the Eiffel Tower was incredible. The atmosphere around it is something special. I walked back along the Seine afterwards and it was a beautifully crisp day — calm, bright, and perfect for taking everything in. Sometimes the simple moments are the best ones. Highly recommend a visit, even if you’re just wandering around the area."
Stoyan Nikolov,5.0,a month ago,"One of the most beautiful words landmarks. Must be seen, especially at night to appreciate the beauty of this tower.
The view from the top is fantastic, there are recently installed safety glass walls around the tower but isn’t an issue to enjoy the view  even if you stay close by.
Only one recommendation- you better buy tickets in advance, basically as early as possible, don’t expect to buy tickets on the spot, you might be lucky but most probably will get staircase access only to the first level, if you want to go to the top - buy tickets in advance.
Yes, there is something very very special in the tower, especially at night.
Best view is from the Trocadero terrace- you just need to across the river."
Ahmed Hossam El-Deen,4.0,4 weeks ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower is an unforgettable experience. The structure itself is iconic, and the view from the top is absolutely stunning. The area around it is lively and perfect for walking and taking photos. Lines can be long, so booking tickets in advance is recommended. A must-see landmark when visiting Paris"
Patrick Lopez,5.0,a month ago,"An amazing site visible from around Paris. No pictures do this Landmark any justice. Seeing this wonder in person truly takes one's breath away. An icon of Paris and its history. And while i did not have the opportunity to go up the tower, it still remained an experience i will remember for my life. I hope to be able to return to visit it once again."
Przemyslaw Kowalski,5.0,a month ago,"I visited the Eiffel Tower last year. It was built in 1889 for the World’s Fair and was meant to show how modern engineering had become. Today it’s one of the most visited places in the world, and when you stand under it, you understand why. Its also a symbol or France.
Inside, the tower has three main levels you can explore. On the first floor, there are displays that explain how the tower was built, a café, and sections of glass floor where you can look straight down to the ground. It feels a bit strange at first, but it’s fun. The second floor is higher and has a great view of Paris: you can see the river, the rooftops, and many famous sights. There are also shops and places to grab something to eat.
If you go to the very top, the view is amazing. You can see the whole city stretching in every direction. There’s also a small room set up to show what the builder’s office once looked like. It’s a nice little detail that helps you imagine the tower’s early days.
Ticket prices depend on how you go up. The lift to the second floor is €23.10 for adults, and climbing the stairs is cheaper, €14.50. If you want to go all the way to the top by lift, it’s around €36.10. Children and young people pay less.
One of my favourite moments was seeing the tower at night. Every evening, once it gets dark, it lights up in a warm golden colour. For five minutes at the start of each hour, it sparkles with thousands of twinkling lights. Watching the tower glow against the night sky feels special, and it gives the whole area a really magical atmosphere.
Wisiting the Eiffel Tower is exciting and surprisingly relaxing once you’re up there. It’s a simple but unforgettable way to see Paris from above eith a glass of champagne in your hand."
Gea Wisesa,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Amazement is an understatement.

The Eiffel Tower is magnificent in real life. I was beyond amaze and really falling in love with the shape of art. It's even prettier with the lights at night time.

I once don't understand why Paris is called city of love, but now I know why."
Carl Frost,5.0,a month ago,We walked up the stairs to the second floor which was a right mission... but so worth it the views as you walk up are brilliant. Had a refreshment stop before heading to the top via the elevator. Stunning views of the city on a very clear fine day...
Trip-a-holic,5.0,4 weeks ago,"A monument that’s worth visiting AT LEAST once in a lifetime! Unfortunately we didn’t have the option of going up the tower - but definitely will next time. A wonderful place to see for sure, magical during the night.
If you want to buy the tickets for going up the tower, get them at least a day in advance."
Angelina Angel,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Better time to come earlier from 11 until 3 pm the line is shorter. Evening after 4 pm the lines is very long.  Tickets up to 5y are free, from 5-11 - 9,10 euro. Adults 38.10 euro. (To go to theTop)"
Noorzidah M N,5.0,Edited a month ago,Beautiful structure no matter which angle you take the photo from whether it's day time or night time. There's a small museum on top of the tower. Amazing views of the surrounding areas around Eiffel Tower. It's good if you take the skip the line ticket as you can go up without queueing.
Sava H,5.0,a month ago,"It's just a miracle. The best place I've ever seen. I recommend it to absolutely everyone. The spirit is breathtaking. And in the evening it's even better because it shimmers. I recommend climbing the tower, the views are beautiful."
bita nasr,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower is a must when in Paris! You can enjoy it from outside for free, but going inside gives you the full experience.

What to See:
•	1st Floor: Small museum-like area with old-style furniture and interactive displays about the tower’s history — really fun and educational, especially for kids.
•	2nd Floor (~115 m): Stunning panoramic views, cafes, and shops. Perfect for photos and taking in the city.
•	Summit (~276 m): The highest point with 360° views and telescopes. You’ll see Paris like never before! Some equipment and antennas are also up here, but they don’t block the view.

Tips:
•	Best times: Early morning or late afternoon to avoid long lines.
•	Tickets: Adults €14–36 depending on floor and stairs/lift; youth 12–24 €7–18; kids 4–11 €3–9; under 4 free. Online booking recommended.
•	Extras: Champagne at the top or guided tours make it extra special.

Recommendation:
Even if the lines look long, go inside — the views and unique experience are worth it. The tower is not just a photo spot; each floor has something interesting to explore, from history to breathtaking sights."
阿宝,4.0,3 weeks ago,"I heard warnings about pickpockets and safety issues around the Eiffel Tower, but our experience was much better than expected.

We arrived via the hop-on hop-off bus, and things felt quite manageable and not as bad as people often say.

We boarded a ferry along the Seine River, which was a lovely way to see the Eiffel Tower and nearby buildings.

The boat had an audio guide explaining the landmarks we passed, which made the ride both relaxing and informative.

One of the most heartwarming moments was seeing people along the river waving at us…. it felt very warm and welcoming.

The kids especially enjoyed the sparkling “blink blink” lights on the tower that shine every 5 minutes each hour.

Unfortunately, the weather was foggy, so we could only see about half of the tower, which was a bit disappointing.

Still, even with limited visibility, the experience was memorable and special in its own way.

Overall, despite the fog and the warnings we heard beforehand, visiting the Eiffel Tower area was a pleasant and enjoyable experience for our family."
Travis Hydzik,5.0,a week ago,"​The Eiffel Tower is truly breathtaking and absolutely lives up to its status as one of the world's most famous landmarks. Its scale and intricate design are even more impressive in person than in photos.
​For the best experience, you should definitely view it from both sides: the gardens and the elevated stairs opposite. However, if you are visiting in winter, keep in mind that the grassy lawns of the Champ de Mars are often fenced off. This is a ""winter rest period"" from mid-October to mid-April to allow the grass to regenerate and prevent it from being trampled during the wetter months.
​Even with the grass closed, you can still get incredible views and photos from the paved pathways and benches around the park's edges. After that, head across the river to the elevated stairs at Trocadéro. This vantage point remains open and offers that classic, postcard-perfect straight-on view that is perfect for photography."
Cory Sakai,5.0,2 months ago,"I don't know how you could not give this iconic structure anything less than five stars. Rain or shine, day or night (because it's lit up), the thing looks beautiful from any direction anytime. The only downside is dealing with all the touts trying to sell you something within eyesight of it. TIP: You'll get the best pictures from the other side of the river, and especially if you go right to the end of the park where you are at a higher elevation."
Bharat Ratan Sharma,5.0,3 weeks ago,"An absolute icon of Paris and a must-visit. Stunning views of the city from the top, especially overlooking the Seine and the gardens below. The structure looks impressive both from outside and when standing underneath it. Long queues can be expected, so booking tickets in advance helps. Best enjoyed on a clear day—and even more magical in the evening when it lights up."
Cesar Franco,5.0,a month ago,"What more to say that has not been said or expressed? This is truly one of the reasons why you wanted to visit Paris. Overall it was safe and magical. We have spent a decent amount of time and different angles of the tower and each is truly beautiful and romantic. Just be mindful with your surroundings and you should be ok. Never felt worried or unsafe while visiting Paris, and we did a lot of walking tours and local neighbourhood visits that just show how beautiful Paris is!"
Anandu,5.0,2 months ago,"Well, I thought this place is overrated.

But once you are nearby Eiffel and witness the glittering of 20000 lights together, it's not longer over hyped. It's worth the hype.

It's like a majestic one standing tall.

You must visit this place with your loved one and click pics and it'll for your lifetime.

The first time view of Eiffel was mesmerizing and once u travel in the metro you can see the Eiffel in the night light and yeah this was the best view.

Entry to the top floors needed tickets and other gardens are of free access.

Overall a life time experience to be honest."
Kelsey Saunders,5.0,4 weeks ago,"A must see in Paris! Highly recommend going to the top! However, you will wait in line for an hour for tickets, fyi. The views are incredible though, and worth it. There are a few shops and a small bistro on the 2nd floor, in case you want souvenirs or you're hungry."
Murali Krishnan,5.0,a month ago,"🌟 Review: Eiffel Tower – A Truly Awe-Inspiring Experience

Visiting the Eiffel Tower was one of the most unforgettable moments of our trip. I was completely amazed by the incredible structure — the details, the engineering, and the sheer size left me wondering how such a masterpiece was built so many years ago. Hearing my elder daughter explain the history and the different phases of construction made the experience even more special. It felt like seeing the tower through her eyes, filled with curiosity and excitement.

Travelling with kids actually made the visit even more enjoyable. Their energy, questions, and excitement added so much joy to the experience. Watching them admire the views from each level and learn new things created beautiful memories for all of us.

Staying at a hotel nearby made everything even more convenient. We could walk to the Eiffel Tower easily and enjoy the surrounding areas without any rush or stress. The combination of easy access, stunning views, and the magical atmosphere made our visit truly perfect.

A must-visit landmark that lives up to every expectation — breathtaking, educational, and unforgettable for the entire family."
Chandrakant Pitroda,5.0,a week ago,"It was my dream to visit Eiffel Tower since I heard a lot about it. During our Paris trip, we planned for it. I felt it is over hyped during today’s time. I would say it is average.
I found view better from outside from few points rather than from the Eiffel Tower. But again it is my personal opinion, others opinion might be different."
Quara KuDuMuz,5.0,2 months ago,"While it is a great experience, few things to mention. I was looking to see the sunset from the top, so i would recommend to book time at least an hour b4 the sunset time. The wait for the 1st lift was about 15 min from timed entry, the wait for the 2nd was over 30 min and it may get very windy on the open platform. I would plan for at least an hour on top, there are 2 levels on top, one enclosed and heated and it offers an amazing view from the open platform. Very rewarding to watch city dressing in the lights.
Now, i found it best to buy tix 60 days in advance from official site, but it may be close to impossible to do outside of same time zone. You have to use VPN and hunt for desired time slot midnight sharp Paris time. You may have to also change local clock to Paris time on top. I would strongly recommend to ""test"" the site few days in advance to understand what to expect. Good luck, enjoy magnificent experience."
Giorgi Mikeladze,5.0,Edited a month ago,"The Most Iconic Photo Backdrop in the World!

As a photographer, I've shot in many beautiful places, but nothing compares to the magic of the Eiffel Tower. I recently had a photoshoot here, and the location is simply breathtaking.

It’s more than just a landmark; it's the heart of Paris. The architecture is stunning from every angle - whether you are shooting from Trocadéro for the classic view, or from the banks of the Seine, or even the charming side streets.

Yes, it can be crowded, but that is part of the vibrant atmosphere. The results are always worth it. The photos aren't just pictures; they are timeless memories filled with romance and Parisian charm. For any couple or individual wanting to capture the spirit of Paris, this is the location. I'm attaching a few photos from my session to show its beauty!"
Rafael Alvarez,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower is one of those experiences that truly lives up to the hype. No matter how many photos you’ve seen before, standing in front of it in person feels completely different. The scale, the details in the ironwork, and the way it dominates the Paris skyline are impressive in a way that’s hard to describe.

Going up the tower is absolutely worth it. The views over Paris are stunning, especially on a clear day. You get a full sense of how beautiful and elegant the city is, with the Seine winding through it and landmarks visible in every direction. Even just spending time at the base, walking around and taking photos, feels special.

Yes, it can get crowded, and lines can be long if you don’t plan ahead. Buying tickets in advance definitely helps. Security is well organized, and staff do their best to keep things moving smoothly despite the number of visitors.

At night, the experience becomes even more magical. When the tower lights up and sparkles, it creates one of the most memorable moments you can have in Paris. It’s romantic, iconic, and something you’ll remember long after your trip is over. A true must-see."
Dmytro Maliuk,4.0,4 months ago,"A timeless masterpiece, but better in autumn🗼

The Eiffel Tower is truly a breathtaking historical landmark. I’m still amazed that such a grand project was built back in 1889 and has been preserved so well to this day. As a historical monument, it’s nothing less than a masterpiece.

That said, I’d strongly recommend visiting in autumn or spring. We went in the summer, and the crowds were overwhelming – it makes the whole experience less enjoyable.

We didn’t go up the tower itself, as all our friends who had visited before advised us against it. They said it wasn’t worth the long queues and the ticket price. Honestly, we enjoyed the tower much more from the outside and from other viewpoints in the city.

Another downside is the aggressive street vendors around the tower. Every few steps you hear “buy this, buy that” — keychains, water bottles, T-shirts, photos. Honestly, it takes away from the magic of the place.

But despite this, the Eiffel Tower is one of those places you have to see at least once in your lifetime. Standing beneath it and realizing its history is truly unforgettable."
Sharon Keyser,5.0,2 months ago,"Visiting the iconic Eiffel Tower was one of the highlights of my trip to Paris!  We had a beautiful Fall day with lots of sunshine.  We went on a weekday and had to wait in line, but it was probably a shorter wait than it would have been on a weekend.  It was worth it!  We went to the top and the views were breathtaking!  We also had dinner in the Tower and it was exceptional.  Overall, it was an experience I will never forget."
Neeru Das,5.0,Edited 3 weeks ago,"Eiffel Tower, a wrought - iron structure located in Paris is a technological masterpiece in building histories.
It was designed and built during 1887 by Gustave Eiffel and then was named in his honor too.

Having a height of 1,083 feet, a  weight of 10,000 tons and revited by 2.5 million rivets, this wondrous scape became the entrance gateway to the International exposition in 1889.
It was erected in two years, with a small labor force and at a low cost.  Designed as a well lit, airy, strong structure, which pioneered a revolution in civil engineering.

It remarkably stands on four lattice girder piers. The glass cage machines were designed by the US Otis Elevator Company, which later became the main feature of the building.

Though, Modifications were made for further international expositions of 1900, 1925, and 1937 but Additions to the tower were made for television transmissions only wherein 66 feet were added to it's height.

The tower features a museum (which we were unable to see), restaurants, and a much talked about Eiffel’s Reception Room providing space for business conferences, cultural events, and social gatherings.
An observation deck is located just under the antenna, at 906 feet.

Proud to have actually been there to see it, feel the awesome greatness of this incredible fascinating structure and partaking a great view of the city.

Naturally, a ticket needs to be bought as per one's time slot. There are lifts to take you up, some shops to let you browse and to buy souvenirs for back home give-aways."
Upma Sharma,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Nothing enough can be said for this historic, iconic and magnificent monument. Loved every bit of experiencing it throughout my Paris trip! You can go up without any lines in winter weekday evenings!"
Nimai Agarwal,5.0,2 weeks ago,"The place does have its own magic or charm. It will be crowded If you visiting in day light. At night will be less crowded and peace
Planning to go up, please buy ticket in advance."
Leena Gale,5.0,3 months ago,Love it. Worth the 30 minute wait in the queue. Took the lift to the top. Fabulous views. Glass of champagne is 24euros. But you can keep the plastic glass as a souvenir. It's tapered so you can't put it down. Was crowded so you have to be patient but amazing visit and definitely as must whilst in Paris
Louie Farhat,5.0,3 months ago,"I just had the most incredible experience at the Eiffel Tower with VIP access! Skipping the long lines made everything effortless, and I could fully enjoy every moment without feeling rushed. The elevator ride itself is amazing, giving you a sense of the tower’s grandeur as you rise above the city.

Once at the top, the views are absolutely breathtaking – the Seine winding through Paris, the Champs-Élysées stretching toward the Arc de Triomphe, and the city’s landmarks unfolding in every direction. Being able to linger, take photos, and simply soak in the atmosphere made the experience truly special.

The tower’s architecture is stunning up close, and from the observation decks, Paris feels alive, endless, and magical. VIP access made it all seamless and comfortable, turning an iconic visit into a relaxed, unforgettable adventure. This was one of the highlights of my trip – a breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime experience I’ll never forget"
Muntaha Malik,5.0,a month ago,A magical place! Standing under the Eiffel Tower felt surreal. The night view is breathtaking and the atmosphere around the tower is full of life. One of the best travel experiences I’ve ever had
Gaurav Singal,5.0,3 months ago,"Our very first visit to the Eiffel Tower was truly special and something we’ll always remember as a family. Seeing this iconic landmark in person with my wife and our 3-year-old son was an emotional and exciting experience. No matter how many times you’ve seen it in photos, standing in front of it is a whole different feeling—the sheer beauty and elegance of the tower are breathtaking.

We chose to go in the evening, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. As the sun began to set, the atmosphere around the Eiffel Tower became magical. The tower looked stunning against the glowing sky, and when it started to sparkle for 5 minutes at the beginning of each hour, it felt like the whole crowd paused to admire it. Watching those golden lights twinkle was a sight that truly gave us goosebumps.

The area was filled with a lively and joyful crowd—tourists, families, and couples all enjoying the moment together. We spent time sitting in the gardens nearby, where our little boy could run around while we relaxed and soaked in the atmosphere. From there, we had a perfect view of the tower as it lit up against the evening sky.

It was such a beautiful family moment—peaceful, yet filled with excitement from everyone around. The Eiffel Tower is not just a monument, but an experience. Sitting there together, watching it sparkle, made our first visit unforgettable and something we’ll treasure forever."
Remon,5.0,2 months ago,"This was our second time visiting the Eiffel Tower, with our last visit around 15 years ago and it was just as magical as we remembered! This time, we brought our children for their first visit, and they absolutely loved it.

The 1st floor has a great atmosphere with several restaurants, including a nice pizza place, perfect for families or anyone looking for a quick, tasty meal. On the 2nd floor, there’s a coffee shop and a few small stores, great for a short break and souvenirs.

At the summit, you’ll find a champagne bar and a truly breathtaking view of Paris especially if you go close to sunset. The view alone makes the visit unforgettable.

I’d highly recommend pre-booking your tickets online to save time. Take the lift to the summit first, then walk down each level to really enjoy everything the tower has to offer. It’s definitely much easier walking down than up!

Overall, a fantastic family experience and a must-do when in Paris whether it’s your first visit or a return trip after many years."

Chakra Puspita,5.0,a month ago,"When we visited, it was very comfortable because there were many police officers on duty. Visitors don't seem to need to worry about safety there, but they should still be aware of their surroundings. An iconic landmark that is always worth visiting in the city of Paris."
Jackie,5.0,a month ago,An iconic landmark for a reason. It’s absolutely beautiful and worth visiting multiple times throughout your visit. That being said I would not recommend staying in a hotel near the Eiffel tower but rather near the arc de triumph.
Arunbhaarat,5.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle by engineer Gustave Eiffel, it was originally meant to be a temporary structure. Today, it stands as a global symbol of Paris and is one of the most visited monuments on earth.

I booked tickets online to reach the top floor of the Eiffel Tower. Online booking is the only way to get tickets, and it is highly in demand on both weekdays and weekends. It is important to book in advance and arrive on time.

After entering the premises, there is a security check to pass through. Depending on your ticket type, you can take the elevator or stairs to reach the second floor. From there, you get a beautiful view of the Paris skyline. If you have tickets for the top floor, you can continue by elevator or stairs to reach the summit.

There are no strict time limits once you reach the top. The top floor usually closes around 6 p.m. I recommend visiting close to sunset to enjoy the stunning views and unforgettable atmosphere.

If you are visiting Paris even once in your lifetime, this is a must see. I strongly suggest going to the top floor without worrying too much about the extra cost. It is absolutely worth it for the incredible experience.

Overall, a memorable and breathtaking visit that should not be missed!"
Tien Nguyen Duy,5.0,a week ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was, without exaggeration, one of the most memorable experiences of my stay in Paris. No matter how many photos you’ve seen before, nothing truly prepares you for the feeling of standing beneath it and looking up. The scale, the elegance, and the intricate iron structure create an overwhelming sense of awe. It’s not just a monument — it genuinely feels like the beating heart of the city.
What impressed me most is how the tower changes depending on perspective. From a distance, it dominates the skyline with confidence and grace. Up close, the fine details of the ironwork become visible, revealing the extraordinary precision and craftsmanship behind the structure. Walking underneath the tower is an experience in itself — the sounds of the city mix with voices from all over the world, creating a vibrant, international atmosphere.
The visit is generally well organized, but it’s important to be prepared. If you want to reach the very top of the tower, you should expect several separate queues along the way. There isn’t just one line — there are multiple stages, and each queue can easily take between 10 and 20 minutes. This applies to ticket checks, elevators, and transitions between levels. While the waiting can feel long, the process is orderly and safe, and knowing this in advance helps manage expectations and avoid frustration.
Going up the tower is absolutely worth the time. The views from above are breathtaking. Paris opens up beneath you — the Seine winding through the city, classic rooftops stretching to the horizon, and famous landmarks visible in every direction. From this height, the city feels calm and harmonious, offering a completely new appreciation of its beauty and layout.
The experience becomes even more magical in the evening. Once the sun sets and the tower lights up, the atmosphere changes entirely. When it begins to sparkle, people naturally stop, smile, and look up together. It’s a shared moment of wonder that feels spontaneous and emotional, whether you’re visiting with someone or standing among strangers.
The surrounding area, especially the Champ de Mars, enhances the visit even more. It’s an ideal place to relax, take photos, or simply sit and admire the tower from different angles. The space feels open, lively, and welcoming at any time of day.
Overall, the Eiffel Tower is far more than a tourist attraction you simply “tick off” a list. It’s a powerful, emotional experience — inspiring, humbling, and unforgettable. Despite the queues, the visit fully rewards your patience. It represents Paris in the most authentic way: elegant, historic, vibrant, and timeless. A true must-see that absolutely lives up to its legendary reputation."
Darius,5.0,a month ago,"I mean you don't really need to look at the reviews. You already know that's something you want to visit and see. Recommandations?

Go to the top floor. And experience it yourself. Worth it for sure.

Suggestion?

Buy tickets earlier and skip the line. Although, waiting in line with all the people has its own charm, but buying tickets beforehand is not a bad idea.

Eiffel tower has a place to get snacks or drinks on the 2nd floor.

Overall: no brainer, would recommend"
Jay Kothari,5.0,Edited 2 months ago,"Great view from the top (actually 2nd floor is enough, don't have to go all the way to the top unless you want to pay extra, IMHO).  All that metal took 2 years 2 months amd 5 days to put together.  328 steps to the 1st floor, and probably the similar to the 2nd floor.  They do have bathrooms on the floors thankfully.  I feel I earned the right to take the elevator back down.
Make sure to buy online tickets in advance, they get booked up fast! Also having an e-ticket gets you into the fast line!"
Matina Papadopoulou,5.0,a month ago,"The view is impressive, but there are long waiting lines for the elevator, which is not ideal. If you can walk, I recommend taking the stairs to the 2nd floor, and if you want to go higher, use the lift until you reach the top. The same applies when going down."
Oguzcan Schmid,5.0,a month ago,"I visited the iconic symbol of Paris together with my wife on a Wednesday evening! We decided to summit in the evening as we wanted to have a view over the city by night. The tower is impressing me every time again. 300 m in height is an amazing experience, especially if you consider the time, when the tower was built in 1889. Astonishing!"
Ioannis Asprokoutelakis,5.0,2 weeks ago,A must see sightseeing if you visit Paris. Try to make the reservation before you go there and try to take the elevator ticket that takes you to the top. The experience from top floor is simply the best 👌!
TCD,5.0,Edited 3 weeks ago,"The Eiffel Tower is truly one of the most iconic experiences in Paris, and it absolutely lives up to the hype! The tower itself is breathtaking (especially at night), and there are so many vantage points around the area to capture the perfect photo—whether you're standing beneath it, looking up at its intricate iron structure, or catching it from across the Seine. It's a photographer's dream!

That said, it’s definitely a super busy area, so if you’re planning to go up the tower, I highly recommend getting tickets in advance to avoid the long lines. I didn’t make it all the way to the top this time, but I’ve heard the views from the summit are absolutely incredible, so that’s definitely on my list for next time!

My favorite part of visiting, though, is simply people-watching! There’s always so much going on around the tower—tourists, locals, street performers, and more. It’s a great place to just sit back, relax, and take in the atmosphere.

Overall, the Eiffel Tower is an essential stop when in Paris, whether you’re going up or just enjoying the view from the ground. It’s one of those places that never gets old!"
Mukesh Srinivasan,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Visited during one of the dreamy days of Paris, Dec 24 2025 on the Christmas eve.

Eiffel tower is so elegant and beautiful to witness. I wish everyone in the world is able to see this beautiful structure!"
Row Dela Peña,5.0,Edited a month ago,It’s an amazing structure but you must see it at night. We did the night cruise and was spectacular view with the lights on. The weather is great so we had a great view of the tower. You have to be creative to get a good shot because people are non stop.
Farnaz Arman,5.0,3 months ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was such a fun experience! I loved how it sparkles for about 5 minutes on the hour, such a magical sight. We checked it out from a few different viewpoints and each one was amazing. The whole atmosphere was very lively and full of good vibes.

A couple tips: I’ve heard there are lots of pickpockets in the area (though we didn’t experience any issues), so it’s good to stay aware. Definitely wear comfy shoes since there’s a lot of walking, and maybe grab a crepe or coffee while you’re there. I also saw people bringing wine and just sitting to enjoy the view, which looked like such a nice way to soak it all in."
Nahnee Awesome,5.0,a month ago,"Magnificent man-made structure, went there during the day and night. The are lights shimmering througout the tower every hour. Also went on the cruise to look at the tower from a distance. Very cold and windy on the second floor. Didnt have to queue up on weekdays noon"
Furkan Özkan,5.0,Edited 3 months ago,"It's a perfect place in a tourist sense but you have to be careful to pickpockets in crowded areas. Street sellers have high priceses but if you try you will get better prices. It was perfect in the night. The lights were amazing. You can easily find it from far places. Toilets were not good.
When you look at the big picture everything was perfect."
Ahmet Çakmak,5.0,2 weeks ago,"It was a perfect climbing. I waited for 3 hours. But I haven't regreted. You must buy ticket for top of tower. Because, there is both waxwork of Mr. Eifel and amazing view. You can eat something in the restaurant and buy gift in Suevenir on the 2nd floor. You can drink campaign at the top of the tower. In short, you must go up Eifel."
Alja Krajšek,5.0,2 months ago,"The tower is breath-taking and worth the wait. If you haven’t purchased the tickets in advance - that is okay! You can do so at the spot. We visited on sunday and we were still able to get them. The wait line was pretty much the same to go by lift or by stairs. Stairs are not scary or tough - I recommend it! We waited an hour to get on. October is probably not the peak of the season as it was not THAT crowded. You need a bit of patience though! But for a summit visit, you MUST book in advance. Loved the view and the architecture!"
Jesika Downs,5.0,Edited 2 months ago,"What a beautiful view. Going to the top was amazing. You got to take your time. You got to buy expensive champagne and enjoy yourself.
Going down to the second floor where the restaurants and the gift shops are is a must do also. They have a cafe. They have a high-end restaurant. They have seeding for you just to sit and enjoy the view."
AJ M,5.0,3 months ago,"Being up there is like a dream! Lots of fun and most people are just happy to be there! You can also buy drinks up there! I had like four glasses of wine👹. HOWEVER! Don’t even waste your time trying to eat at the restaurant. The hostess is delightful, but the servers are obviously unhappy with their existence. I’m willing to pay the prices and these people don’t want to serve me? Come on! ALSO! Buy a drink at a restaurant and use the bathroom before heading there. The bathrooms there are outrageous! So many people, and if you speak English, overweight French people will yell at you! Girl I am just in line to use the bathroom! What did I do to you?😂 Just tell them you don’t understand and walk away🥰."
Lord Tyrone Ashton,5.0,a month ago,"First time going up the Eiffel tower for me and my fiancee, didn't think my fiancee would conquer her fear of heights and go up to the summit along with walking along the glass floor but she absolutely smashed it. We even had champagne with our ticket, the views were amazing but did find getting up very chaotic. Long waits which wasn't as bad as on the way down due to 2 lifts out of 4 failing causing chaos to get down. Lucky for us we were at the front of the queue but it was still quite some time before we reached the bottom. Although this happened we would both still highly recommend doing this experience as this is an old structure from 1889 and we understand that is not always going to run as smooth as you expect."
Dinyar Mistry,5.0,2 months ago,"Truly mesmerising structure! And this was made in 1889! Loved the place and the lift to the top
Beautiful view of Paris from the top! Also need to see it during the day and again at night when it's lit up! Post 7pm every hour or also sparkles, which makes it the most beautiful thing in Paris!"
Oluwatimileyin Adedigba,4.0,Edited 2 weeks ago,"Classic. The view doesn't get old. You get a sense of the whole city.

You feel so small once you go close to the tower. Pictures don't do justice. You just have to be there."
Mike Naylor (Chief),5.0,3 weeks ago,"Can you really go to France and not go to the Eiffel Tower?  To miss a visit to the Tower is to miss out.
You can go into the grounds for free but will need to go through security, and it will cost you to go up the Tower itself - but it is so very worth it.  You have the option to go halfway up or you can pay a little extra and go all the way to the very top, although expect to wait in line a while as the lifts to the very top are quite small and the queues are long.
Once you are at the top it's clear to see it was worth it. There are both indoor and outdoor viewing points, a very small champagne shop, and (thankfully) a toilet.
My words will never do it justice so I highly recommend paying a visit.

GOOD 👍
It's an iconic landmark with amazing views.

BAD 👎
Does get busy and isn't cheap. But did you really expect it to be otherwise?"
Vincern Tan,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Definitely a must-do in Paris. Bought 1700hr ticket to top floor from official website. Going through security was a breeze. No queue. Queue for elevator to 2nd floor 5 min. However, expect longer time for elevator to top floor. We queued for about 15-20min. All effort was worth it for the views. Highly recommended."
nure SK,5.0,4 months ago,"A masterpiece in city of Romance!!! Busy as we went during the summer holidays but nice area to relax with a picnic.

Be careful as there is a lot of folks walking around to pick pocket and also pester tourists.

You must visit and enter the tower. Lovely views when near by and just impressive to visit."
Nyasha Drinkwater,5.0,4 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is absolutely magical both during the day and at night. In the daytime, the views from the top are breathtaking.  Paris stretches out in every direction, and it’s worth every step of the climb. My young kids managed it easily, so don’t be put off, it’s very doable for families. The tickets are great value too! only €14.50 for adults and €7 for children. For such an iconic landmark, that’s fantastic!

At night, the Eiffel Tower transforms into something truly spectacular. Every hour, on the hour, it sparkles for five minutes, and the sight is unforgettable, like something out of a fairytale. Standing beneath it while it twinkles is one of those “wow” moments you’ll never forget.

Highly recommend visiting both by day and night. It’s an absolute must when in Paris!"
Greg King,5.0,a month ago,"Life long wait. It is more beautiful in person. Much larger than i thought and beautifully constructed. i stared for hours once i got there. They sell snacks and soft drinks under the tower. you have to go though a security check to enter. it is totally free of xharge. if you want to take the elevator to the middle or top of the tower, there are tickets ypu van buy. Long lines typically."
Mr. Farnood,5.0,2 months ago,"visiting the Eiffel Tower is an extraordinary experience. Beyond being an iconic symbol of Paris, it represents a masterpiece of 19th-century engineering and design innovation. The use of exposed iron structure, precision in detailing, and elegance in proportions make it both a technical and aesthetic triumph. Standing beneath it, you can truly appreciate how revolutionary Gustave Eiffel’s vision was for its time. The panoramic views from the top are breathtaking, but equally impressive is observing the tower’s structure up close, it’s a lesson in structural clarity, material honesty, and timeless design. A must-see not just for tourists, but for anyone who appreciates architecture and engineering excellence."
Misran,5.0,2 months ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was truly one of the most unforgettable moments of my life. Seeing this world-famous landmark in photos is one thing, but standing right beneath it is a completely different experience it genuinely takes your breath away. From the moment I arrived, I was amazed by its incredible architecture and the feeling of history and romance that surrounds the entire place.

I visited in the late afternoon, and it was the perfect time. Watching the sunset over Paris from the top was magical the whole city slowly lit up as the golden light faded, and then suddenly, the tower began to sparkle with thousands of twinkling lights. The atmosphere was filled with excitement; people were cheering, taking photos, and simply admiring the view in silence.

The view from the top is something I’ll never forget. You can see all of Paris the Seine River winding through the city, the Louvre, Notre Dame, and the charming rooftops stretching out in every direction. The lift ride itself was smooth, and everything was well-organized. The staff were polite and helpful, guiding visitors kindly even though it was quite crowded.

There are small cafés and souvenir shops inside where you can grab a coffee or a light snack, which makes the experience even better. I also loved walking around Champs de Mars Park afterward it’s one of the best spots to take photos of the tower, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour.

Overall, the Eiffel Tower truly lives up to its reputation. It’s not just a monument it’s a symbol of beauty, art, and human creativity. Whether you visit during the day or at night, it leaves you with a sense of wonder and appreciation for Paris. I would absolutely recommend every traveler to visit at least once in their lifetime."
Aprilyn,5.0,a month ago,"Even without going up(the line was too long), the Eiffel Tower is absolutely stunning! Seeing it up close, especially when it lights up at night, feels magical. The atmosphere around the tower is lively, beautiful, and worth every minute. A perfect Paris moment!"
N cam,5.0,2 months ago,"We hadn't made an appointment, but climbing the tower was still easy. We bought tickets to the top. The elevator stopped on the second floor, allowing us to explore. Then we took the elevator back up. At the top, the view was quite beautiful, with autumn colors, the Seine River, the ferry ride, and the city views."
Violina Pesheva,5.0,3 months ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was truly unforgettable! The structure is even more breathtaking in person than in photos. From the moment you arrive, the atmosphere feels magical — the gardens are well-kept, the staff is friendly, and everything is organized for a smooth experience.

The views from the top are absolutely incredible. You can see all of Paris laid out before you: the Seine, the Arc de Triomphe, and endless charming rooftops. Whether during the day with clear skies or at night when the tower sparkles, it’s a sight that makes you fall in love with the city all over again.

I highly recommend booking tickets in advance to skip the long lines and give yourself time to enjoy a leisurely visit. The restaurants nearby and inside the tower are also worth trying if you’d like to make the most of the experience.

A must-see landmark that completely lives up to its reputation. Paris wouldn’t be the same without it!"
Matt Toews,5.0,2 months ago,"Amazing! The history behind the tower is pretty interesting to learn about.
We went on a weekday in October and there was no waits for anything. It was still busy but much easier to manage than in summer. A lot less pickpockets too."
Andrew Peluso,5.0,3 weeks ago,"The Eiffel Tower did not disappoint. Grab a beret and a baguette and look closer than the postcards. From far away, the tower seems light and decorative, but up close it feels strong and precise. The iron “lace” is not decoration. It is the structure itself. Every curve and crisscross helps the tower stand tall against gravity and wind.

Gustave Eiffel designed the tower with wind in mind. As the tower rises, it becomes narrower because strong winds hit higher levels with more force. The curved shape lets wind pass around it instead of pushing straight against it. This design choice is why the tower has survived storms for more than a hundred years.

One of the most interesting features is that nothing is hidden. The iron beams, joints, and rivets are all visible. Over 18,000 iron pieces are held together by millions of rivets, allowing the tower to expand and contract as temperatures change. Even the elevators follow the curve of the legs instead of moving straight up. The Eiffel Tower proves that smart engineering can be beautiful without trying to be fancy."
M R,5.0,Edited 3 months ago,"The iconic Eiffel Tower is the most photographed structure in the world.  We visited on a weekday between rain showers on a windy night and still had a great time.  I'd suggest you buy tickets in advance and consider going when it's raining or in the evening before closing time as there's much less people.  Be absolutely sure what type of ticket your purchasing and make sure you're buying the ticket from the official website.  Double check the ticket is for 1st, 2nd or Top floor access.  Don't walk up the stairs to the 2nd floor unless you're in good shape for 600+ outdoor stairs.  (Even walking down the stairs is taxing on the legs.)  We noticed the elevators were always completely filled, so watch your belongings and children.  There's limited seating under and around the Tower and very limited rain/weather cover so bring a jacket if the weather is a concern.  Also, the temperatures and wind on the top will be different from ground level.  Expect it to be cooler and windy.  And definitely use the restroom before you go up the Tower.  Be mindful of your surroundings and watch your valuables transiting to/from the Tower area.   And finally, taxis usually que up on the major roads surrounding the Tower."
Ana Júlia Matiazo,5.0,a month ago,"Easy to get there by public transport. If you want to save some money and buy the stairs ticket, be prepared to do some cardio exercise!!! Best to buy the ticket in advance, and a good tip is to go just before the sun sets. This way you can have the view of the city during the day and night."
Keysha Dean,5.0,4 months ago,"One of my favorite stops during my family's vacation.  The history, experience, and beautiful view absolutely wonderful. If you're ever vacationing in Paris it's a must see tourist location.  You can walk up the tour or take the lift. Enjoying an absolutely amazing view of the city. I would definitely recommend the experience."
Gina L,5.0,3 months ago,"Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower was neat, but the process could be better organized. They don't allow you in until your scheduled time, so you are in li e a while, even past your time, no problem.  You get on the elevator. When it stops, you are not to the top. You are told to get out and get in another line to go to the top. You are in a line with everyone else waiting to go up, no matter what time you were scheduled to go up. We waited about 30-45 minutes in that line. The views were wonderful, though! We got some great photos, despite the not so great weather."
Viktor Molnár,5.0,2 months ago,"This is the most authentic sights in Paris. You had better to come here in workday, because the waiting queue is very long in every time. We have gone there on sunday evening and we had to wait to reach the top about 2 hours. But the view is amazing from the top of the tower. In every hours for 5-10 minutes the lights are blinking. You must see it. You had better to buy the tickets in advance."
Ahmad Barboud,5.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, and seeing it in person is an unforgettable experience.

lg G,5.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic and breathtaking landmarks in the world, and visiting it is an unforgettable experience. Standing tall in the heart of Paris, it perfectly captures the city’s elegance and romantic atmosphere. From the moment you see it rising above the skyline, whether in the daylight or beautifully illuminated at night, it’s impossible not to be amazed by its architectural beauty and historical significance.

Climbing or taking the elevator up the tower offers spectacular panoramic views of Paris you can spot famous sites like the Seine River, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Each level has something special to offer, from scenic viewpoints to charming cafés and souvenir shops. Watching the sunset from the top is simply magical, as the city lights begin to twinkle below.

At night, the Eiffel Tower transforms into a dazzling spectacle, sparkling every hour with thousands of lights, creating one of the most romantic and memorable sights in the world. The surrounding Champ de Mars gardens and Trocadéro area are perfect for relaxing, taking photos, or enjoying a picnic while admiring the tower’s beauty.

Caleb Chai,5.0,a month ago,"An Unforgettable First Visit to the Eiffel Tower

This was my very first time visiting the iconic Eiffel Tower, and the moment I saw it in real life, I felt a rush of excitement. Photos really don’t prepare you for how grand and beautiful this tower is — it truly takes your breath away.

I decided to go all the way to the top, and it was absolutely worth it. The panoramic view of Paris from above is stunning — the entire city looks unreal, almost like a painting. Standing there, so high up, soaking in the skyline… it was an unforgettable experience.

Whether it’s your first visit or your tenth, the Eiffel Tower has a special kind of magic. I’m so glad I went up — definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Paris."
Hania216,5.0,3 months ago,"I visited the Eiffel Tower in the evening to watch the sunset. The view was absolutely stunning as the sun slowly disappeared behind the Paris skyline, painting the sky in warm colors.

After enjoying the view, we stopped at the café on the first level for coffee and a light snack. Sitting there, surrounded by the soft evening breeze and the sound of people chatting, made the experience even more special.

We spent about an hour and a half on our way down, taking our time to explore each level and enjoy the changing perspective of the city as the lights came on. Watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle against the night sky was the perfect ending to a magical visit."
Iroshan,5.0,Edited 4 weeks ago,"We visited the Eiffel Tower on a weekday, and it was easily one of the most enjoyable ways to experience Paris’s most famous landmark. Because it wasn’t a weekend, the area felt noticeably less crowded, which made everything calmer — more space to walk, easier to take photos, and a much more relaxed atmosphere overall.

Instead of focusing only on going up the tower, we spent most of our time enjoying the surrounding area, and that turned out to be the best part for our family. Walking around the Champ de Mars and the nearby paths gave us so many beautiful angles of the tower without feeling rushed. We took our time, paused often for family photos, and just enjoyed the moment — watching the tower rise above the city while the Paris life moved around us.

The vibe on a weekday is also different: fewer tour groups, less noise, and it feels more like you’re seeing the Eiffel Tower as part of everyday Paris rather than a crowded tourist rush. We strolled, admired the views, and enjoyed the fresh air and the scenery, which made it feel like a proper Paris memory rather than a quick checklist stop.

If you’re planning to visit, I highly recommend going on a weekday and giving yourself time to explore the area around it. Even without rushing into a big itinerary, simply being there — walking, taking pictures, and soaking in the atmosphere — is already an unforgettable Paris experience."

Lillian Paulsen,5.0,a month ago,"Not too crowded and easy to get photos and a good veiw in early November. Highly recommend, beautiful. Didn't go up, just walked pass however."
Ewest,5.0,4 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is truly iconic – a symbol of Paris that’s just as beautiful in person as it is in photos. Whether you're viewing it from the nearby gardens or enjoying it from underneath, it’s an unforgettable sight.

The area around the tower is lively and full of great spots to take pictures.

Even without going up, just being near the Eiffel Tower is an experience in itself.
It is so impressive.
Definitely worth a visit if you're in Paris!"
Salman Saeed,5.0,4 months ago,"Amazing experience visiting the Tower! We explored all levels with a fantastic guided tour that brought the history to life. The views were breathtaking, and every level had something unique to offer. The guide was informative and engaging, making the visit even more memorable. Everything was well organized and smooth from start to finish. Highly recommend for anyone visiting the region!"
Oleksandra Starynets,5.0,3 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is the true symbol of Paris and one of the most breathtaking landmarks in the world! The panoramic view of the city is unforgettable, especially at sunset and at night when the tower sparkles with thousands of lights. The atmosphere is magical, and you can feel the spirit of Paris in every detail. A must-visit at least once in a lifetime!"
Aravinth,5.0,2 months ago,"It's true - The city of love.. 💖 Paris Eiffel 🗼. There was a wait time of 30-40 min, even if you have purchased ticket in advance to climb the tower.
After tower visit you can also walk into the gardens for a nice photos.
The lights will be turned on usually when it gets darker.
And every 1 hour for 5 minutes the glitter 🪩 lights also turned on.."
Perth2Go . au,5.0,2 months ago,"Probably one of, if not my favourite touristy landmark on the planet. It's so amazingly grand and imposing no matter where you see it from. All the metalwork looks incredible! I took the staircase up and down, which was a great climb. You're then treated to amazing views of the entire Paris skyline. The parks beneath are also incredibly well kept, and contribute to the tower feeling larger than life."
Angie B,5.0,4 months ago,"Absolutely loved this expedience! Just as magical as i had imagined it.
the weather was a bit windy but it was fine! I recommend wearing a coat if the weather is a little cool!

We took the lift to the second level and had the most beautiful view!
So romantic. Can’t wait to go back"
Sourabh Tripathi,5.0,2 months ago,"Beautiful monument. But the climb is not worth in case you want to see the Paris from up above? Then, you can book the tickets for it.Else no need to book any ticket.
In the night, there is a light show in which they sparkle. They complete tower every hour, which is a must see thing."
Omar L,5.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is honestly breathtaking, and it truly deserves a place among the modern wonders of the world. Whether you see it glowing under the sun or shining beautifully under the moon, it completely pulls you in. During the day, this massive and intimidating tower rises higher than your eyes can follow and demands attention from every single angle (and trust me, it does not have a bad side). But at night, that is when the real magic hits. Covered in thousands of golden lights, it becomes absolutely hypnotizing. I was completely mesmerized standing under it after dark, and I couldn’t look away no matter how hard I tried. And forget the pictures and videos you’ve seen online because they don’t even come close. Do yourself a favor and go see it in person. You and the people you love deserve that experience. Honestly, even five stars feels like an insult because it is just that beautiful.

I didn’t make it all the way to the top, and honestly, it didn’t matter. Just standing on the ground and looking up at it towering over me left me completely speechless. It makes you feel tiny and humbled but also inspired in a way that is hard to explain. The Eiffel Tower is not just something to check off a travel list, it is an experience you have to feel for yourself. Go see it, stand beneath it, and let it blow your mind because five stars will never be enough to describe how extraordinary it truly is."
Jaemin Kim,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Beautiful, stunning, must-visit. Don’t stop at just viewing the Eiffel Tower from far, make sure to climb it as well. It got a bit chilly in November, but the view was one to remember.

We took the elevator up but descended down the stairs for the experience. Was it worth it? Not quite sure. But it was very enjoyable overall."
Em V,5.0,a month ago,"I realize the Eiffel Tower is super touristy, but you can’t be in Paris and not check it out. It’s definitely worth going all the way to the top …though, I’ll admit, it’s not for the faint of heart. I don’t have a fear of heights, but even I felt a little uneasy up there at times! 😅 I went up during the day and came back at night and both experiences felt totally different. The view during the day is stunning but at night the lights on the tower are just magical. Highly recommend doing both if you can! It’s a must-see when you’re in Paris."
Benjamin “BK” Kenney,5.0,2 months ago,"Breathtaking, magnificent, and truly a sight to behold. We absolutely loved every moment taking it in. The best viewing spot we found was off 11 Av. de la Bourdonnais, 75007 Paris — perfect for photos and enjoying the tower in all its glory. A must-see experience that captures the magic of Paris!"
Taimoor,5.0,3 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is more than just a landmark; it's the symbol of Paris and an engineering marvel that truly lives up to the hype. Yes, it will be crowded, and yes, it requires planning, but the experience is 100% worth it.

The experience is what you make it. You can simply admire its intricate ironwork from the Champ de Mars gardens with a picnic (a fantastic free option), or you can ascend to the top for breathtaking, unparalleled views of Paris.

Here’s what to expect:

· The Views: Absolutely spectacular. Seeing the city layout from above, with the River Seine winding through the streets and monuments like the Arc de Triomphe and Sacré-Cœur in the distance, is unforgettable. The second level offers the best balance for photos. The very top is a unique, thrilling experience, though the views are naturally more panoramic than detailed.
· The Structure: Being on the tower itself is awe-inspiring. Looking down through the glass floors or just feeling the scale of the ironwork up close is incredible.
· The Atmosphere: There's a palpable buzz of excitement from visitors from all over the world. It's especially magical at night when the tower sparkles for five minutes on the hour, every hour.

A few tips for a better visit:

· BOOK TICKETS ONLINE IN ADVANCE! This is the most important advice. Queues for tickets can be hours long. Pre-booking a timed slot saves an immense amount of time and stress.
· Consider the stairs. If you're able, taking the stairs to the second floor is often faster, cheaper, and offers a unique, up-close perspective of the structure.
· Go at different times: Sunset is a popular time for a reason – you get to see the city in daylight, at golden hour, and then lit up at night. But early morning can be less crowded.
· Security check: There is a security check to enter the plaza, so expect a queue even with pre-booked tickets.

An essential Parisian experience. It’s busy, it's touristy, but it's also magnificent and unforgettable. Plan ahead, be patient, and prepare to be amazed.
· Unforgettable, iconic views of Paris
· Historic and engineering masterpiece
· Magical atmosphere, especially at night
· Different ticket options (stairs vs. elevator) to suit your budget"
Subhra Chowdhury,5.0,a month ago,"Of Course it was an amazing experience. Couple of tips.
DO not fret if you are not able to book online. Stand in the que 30 mins early to opening. You will get in the first lot.
Buy the souvenirs from the shop under the tower, they are better quality.
Avoid the food shops under the tower they are super expensive
The restaurants around the tower are tourist traps, they serve good food but again more expensive. If you want food with a view of the tower go for it
Boat tour with dinner was a waste of time. Book the sunset tours without food. They are the best"
Jorge Alma,5.0,4 months ago,"I recently visited the Eiffel Tower and it absolutely lives up to the hype — it’s enormous and breathtaking in person. Seeing the iron lattice rise into the sky is one thing in photos, but standing beneath it and looking up at the structure that soars about 330 meters (roughly 1,083 feet) is an unforgettable sensation. The scale and engineering are phenomenal, and the views from the platforms are spectacular.

The area around the tower is just as charming. Classic Parisian buildings, broad promenades and the manicured lawns of the Champ de Mars give the whole spot a timeless, romantic feel. From the elegant Haussmann-era façades nearby to the vista across the Seine toward Trocadéro, the surrounding architecture makes wandering the neighborhood a joy — perfect for photos, relaxed strolls, and soaking in Parisian atmosphere.

It’s also a very popular place, so expect big crowds; people from all over the world gather here to admire the monument and take in the scenery. Because of that volume of visitors, be mindful of your belongings. Pickpockets operate in crowded tourist spots, and there are street hustles and game scammers who may try to distract you or pressure you into playing quick “games” that aren’t fair. Keep bags zipped and close, avoid carrying valuables in easily accessible pockets, and politely decline invitations from anyone hawking games or insisting you join impromptu activities.

All that said, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see — its sheer size and the beautiful historic surroundings make it an iconic Paris experience. With a little common-sense vigilance, you can fully enjoy one of the world’s most impressive landmarks."
Frank Adrian Martinez Asilda,5.0,5 months ago,"Amazing experience visiting the Tower! We explored all levels with a fantastic guided tour that brought the history to life.

İlayda Karimca,5.0,2 weeks ago,It’s the most iconic place in Paris. This tower is the most beautiful and magnificent architecture icon. Everytime when I see this architecture tower I fall in love. That’s why I love Paris 🇫🇷 Merci Gustave Eiffel designed that !!
1000thousand Steps,4.0,3 months ago,"Strange to be in such an icon. If you can, be there on a more interesting day than blue skies. The view rewards you with drama, and the crowds are fewer.
Ascent by mix of stairs and lifts.
It is typically very windy at the top, be prepared. And there can be long queues to get up there. Better out of summertime.
Eateries on the lower floors, but very expensive, though some more reasonable prices are in sandwich bars.
So, some of the best views of Paris, but when you look out, there’s no Eiffel Tower to see to remind you you’re in Paris. I think I prefer being on the outside looking in.
Especially, enjoy the view from the Trocadero at night. Much better."
Daniel,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Wow, it is a must when you visit Paris. We did the lift to the top and it was worth very dollar. We did the 1030 session which was perfect with a lack of people. By the time we got down it was a little crowded. We went back at night for the lights and it was crowded."
Lyn Lee,5.0,3 weeks ago,"We had the 9:30 am ticket slot, and you’ll need to go through security screening before entering the tower. Taking the lift to the summit was honestly the best decision—I didn’t have to tire myself out walking up, and I could just enjoy the view right away. From the top, you can choose to come back down either by stairs or by lift, so it’s really flexible depending on how you feel.

There was a short wait for the lift, it moved fairly quickly. I definitely recommend getting your ticket in advance to save time."
Lexi W,5.0,2 months ago,"I dreamed about visiting the eiffel tower ever since I was a little girl, and it absolutely lived up to the hype. It is positively huge in person. Walking up the stairs was not very difficult and the views were incredibly rewarding. I would do it again many times. I came to see the tower all 4 days of my Paris visit because it truly is that stunning in person. An absolute dream come true!"
Henri T. De Souza,5.0,2 months ago,"Free and Fascinating Visit to the Eiffel Tower Grounds

Improved Review:
No tickets needed — free access to the Eiffel Tower grounds is available! After passing a quick security checkpoint, you can stroll through the lovely gardens and ponds while taking in the view of this iconic landmark.

At the center of the structure, you’ll find a QR code that activates an AI version of Gustave Eiffel, sharing fascinating historical insights about the tower’s major milestones — a fun and educational touch!

The area is wheelchair accessible and includes public restrooms. It stays open until 11 PM, with several restaurants, souvenir shops, and snack stands nearby. You can also purchase tickets on-site to reach the middle or top levels for a full experience.

A must-see and easy stop in Paris!"
Jeff Skinner,5.0,Edited a month ago,"Just as you would expect, this is breathtaking. Make sure to purchase your tix in advance or you will face extremely long lines/waits. Went in November and the cold/wind was dreadful. Wear a winter hat, long pants/sweater if you have them. The views were spectacular as promised. If you go at sunset you won’t be disappointed, you see the city in daylight and can watch as the lights come on across the city, and go right to the top or you will regret it, unless you’re going to be back."
Griffin Puc,5.0,3 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is definitely worth experiencing at least once—it’s an incredible landmark and going up offers amazing views of Paris. That said, it’s extremely busy, so be prepared for crowds and lines. Still, the atmosphere and the perspective from the top make it a memorable stop."
Luis David García Díaz,5.0,5 months ago,"It's as good as you imagine.
Impressive view, have a picnic in the gardens around to take it all in.

The best way to get tickets is online. Try at different times as some times some new tickets to the top come up.
36€ but totally worth it, astonishing view!"
Nick W.,5.0,a month ago,"If you’re looking for the most Parisian experience imaginable, allow me, a discerning infant wearing a beret, striped shirt, and a rather powerful moustache, to give it to you straight: the Eiffel Tower absolutely delivers.

Atmosphere
The ambiance is impeccable. Gray skies? Très chic. Tower sparkling in the background? Oui, oui. The lawn was perfect for dramatic baby poses and for contemplating the deeper meaning of baguettes.

Cultural Immersion
Nothing says “I’ve embraced the spirit of France” like being under the Eiffel Tower while gripping a baguette half your size. Locals seemed impressed; tourists looked confused; pigeons feared me. All appropriate reactions to my vibe.

Comfort & Amenities
I was held the entire time, which I found acceptable. Zero crawls were required.

Snack Options
My baguette was artisanal, crunchy, and approximately the length of my torso. I recommend bringing your own baked goods unless you are prepared for the emotional impact of tasting bread this good for the first time.

Final Verdict

As a baby of exquisite taste and an emerging authority on international landmarks, I give the Eiffel Tower 5 out of 5 baguettes.

Perfect for photos, mustaches (real or otherwise), and cultivating a lifelong sense of European flair."
uma yakinlar,5.0,2 weeks ago,"Had a great experience with my boyfriend here visiting the Eiffel tower for the first time!

At first it seemed like there were no tickets left to the highest top of the tower but we decided to still give it a try and ask if there somehow were few tickets available and then for our luck we got the tickets!

It really made our evening even better and was definitely worth it to visit there, the views at the top were incredible! And the price for us was only about 14€ per person being under the age of 24👍"
Dave Cooke,5.0,4 months ago,"Amazing place to visit. If your in Paris mate this the place to go. We used the Big Bus company tour bus to get about and visit all the iconic place like Eiffel Tower.

The lift experience is great, a d super views from each of the levels. Be sure to visit level 1, glass floors and great pop up gardens"
Yaduveer Singh,5.0,2 months ago,"If your goal is to photograph or enjoy the Eiffel Tower rather than climb it, here’s some good news — you don’t need a ticket to have an amazing experience! Some of the best views are actually outside the tower itself, and they’re completely free to access.

---

📸 Why You Don’t Need a Ticket

No ticket or queues: You can skip the long lines and elevator waits — just find a great vantage point and shoot freely at your own pace.

Famous external photo spots: Excellent views from nearby streets include Rue de l’Université, Rue de Buenos-Aires, and Avenue de Camoëns — all well-loved by professional photographers and Instagram travelers.

Flexible timing: Without a set ticket time, you can visit at sunrise, golden hour, twilight, or late night to capture the Tower under different moods and lighting.

Budget-friendly: You save both money and time, focusing purely on the atmosphere and the view.

Perfect for casual visitors or photographers: If your goal is the Eiffel Tower in your frame, not from its top, this approach is ideal.

---

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

No interior access: You’ll miss the inside structure and the panoramic city views from the top — this experience is purely from the outside.

Crowds at popular spots: Iconic areas like Trocadéro and Rue de l’Université can get crowded, especially at sunset, so patience helps.

Lighting is key: For the best shots, plan your timing — morning light offers soft tones, while sunset provides warm golden hues.

Not entirely “secret”: Many of these locations now appear in travel guides and social media, so expect other photographers too.

Plan some time: You’ll still spend time walking or taking transport to reach the best angles, so schedule accordingly.

💡 Pro Tip

For the most unique and crowd-free shots, arrive just after sunrise or visit during the blue hour (after sunset) — the Eiffel Tower’s golden illumination against the evening sky is unforgettable."
Angelo Alfonso Mezzina,5.0,a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower is a magical experience. You can go with a loved one or completely solo and the feeling is the same, truly unforgettable. Also, seeing all of Paris from the top is honestly one of the coolest things you can do."
Taye O,5.0,4 months ago,"Seeing the Eiffel Tower during the day was cool, but  nothing prepared me for the magic of seeing it at night. It's truly a different experience. The hourly sparkles and glittering lights was breathtaking. One of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen. Absolutely unforgettable!"
Balamurali T,5.0,Edited 3 weeks ago,"I visited the Eiffel Tower in early November and highly recommend going during the evening and staying through the night to witness the magical sparkle lighting. It was truly breathtaking and added a special charm to the experience. We booked a Seine River cruise along with the Eiffel Tower visit, which made the trip even more memorable. Having a guide helped us understand the rich history and fascinating stories behind this iconic landmark. Overall, it was a beautiful and well-organized experience that I would strongly recommend to anyone visiting Paris.

You can get beautiful Eiffel Tower keychains and memorable miniature towers at great prices during the closing hours. 😊"
Isabelle Ana-Maria,5.0,a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower is even more impressive in person. The lighting at night creates a magical atmosphere, and the view from the top is unforgettable. The queues can be long, but the experience is definitely worth it. A beautiful landmark that everyone should visit at least once while in Paris."
Killian Nova,5.0,a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron landmark in Paris, France, built for the 1889 World's Fair and originally intended as a temporary structure. Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it was the world's tallest building for 41 years and is now a globally recognized symbol of Paris and France's ""Iron Lady"". Today, it is a major tourist attraction with three visitor levels, restaurants, and viewing platforms.
Construction and design
Builder: Gustave Eiffel's company designed and built the tower.
Construction timeline: Construction took two years, two months, and five days, from January 1887 to March 1889.
Materials: It is made of wrought iron, using over 18,000 pieces and 2.5 million rivets.
Height and structure
Height: It stands 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, including its antenna, which makes it the tallest structure in Paris.
Levels: The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.

Stairs: There are 1,665 steps to the top, though elevators are available for public use."
Oscar,5.0,3 months ago,"Here the Eiffel tower from different point of view of the city. For sure, very important monument in Paris which give personality and actitude to the city. Is a most to see from down of the tower and different places as Trocadero, boat, champ of mars, etc everywhere. I hope you enjoy my pictures."
Gaurang Prajapati,5.0,3 weeks ago,"No Doubt the Number One Attraction in Paris.

I must say that the beauty of Tower in night is far more prettier than in day time. In the day time it just looks like a gigantic Iron Structure only."
Sumit Mundhada,5.0,5 months ago,"Awesome place to visit no doubt. I would recommend buying the ticket online in advance though. We had to wait for quite some time in line and the summit was closed when we were standing in line. They close the top floor tickets intermittently. So beware. Also, if you are in a group then you all need to be present while purchasing the ticket."
Mari Alma,5.0,2 months ago,"Great view, tickets not expensive, you can buy them on site price depending on whethwr you want to be brave and take all the stairs to the top or pay extra and ride the elevator. There is a line, depending on peak season or not that's how long will take. Bathroom in every level and snacks also."
Brian Henwood,5.0,2 months ago,"We had a great guide (Natali) that enabled us to skip the line. Your bags will be screened twice like at airports so no metal objects, padlocks, knives  scissors, etc allowed. The views are amazing but on 2nd level it gets very cold & windy. We took the Funicular lift & then stairs down later. Plenty of free time up there too."
nora shoieb,4.0,4 months ago,"I've been looking forward to seeing it more than any other place but it was so crowded that I couldn't go up. I visited during the weekend and a day before the national day so many photo spots around the tower were closed. I took pictures outside instead. The best thing about it, is how it's visible from any street in the surrounding area. I'll go again next time to go up and see the view."
Dina Shabsough,5.0,3 months ago,"✨ Visiting the Eiffel Tower for the first time was such a special experience. It’s even bigger and more impressive in person than I imagined — truly a symbol of Paris that takes your breath away the moment you see it. During the day, the view of the tower is stunning from every angle, but at night it becomes even more magical.

Starting at 9:00 pm, the tower sparkles with lights every hour, and it’s honestly one of the most beautiful sights I’ve ever seen. Standing there and watching it glitter against the night sky felt unforgettable, a real “wow” moment. The atmosphere around the tower is also lively and full of energy, with people gathering just to enjoy the view.

💡 My tip would be to arrive a little early before the first sparkle show at 9:00 pm so you can find a good spot to watch. If you go up the tower, the views of Paris are breathtaking both day and night.

🇫🇷 Overall, the Eiffel Tower is everything you expect and more, iconic, beautiful, and a must-see when in Paris. 🗼✨"
Ayat Tadjalli,5.0,4 months ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was an absolutely unforgettable experience! The sheer beauty and grandeur of this iconic landmark left me amazed from the moment I saw it. Whether you’re standing at the base admiring its incredible structure or taking in the breathtaking panoramic views of Paris from the top, it truly feels magical.

The atmosphere is vibrant both during the day and at night, especially when the tower sparkles with its famous light show. It’s not just a monument—it’s a symbol of Paris and a must-see for anyone visiting the city.

I highly recommend adding the Eiffel Tower to your itinerary. It’s an experience that will stay with you forever!"
Septiana Fitri Maria,5.0,a month ago,"I would prefer to visit at night to see the lights. It will be sparkling every hour, and the best place to see is in the Place du Trocadero. It is very convenient with Metro Line 6 and Line 9 just in front of the building. Cafes are around the corner. If you come during mid November-December, you can also visit the Christmas Market in this area. Enjoying chat with friends/families, while looking at the Eiffel in front of you and sipping a typical winter drink: hot apple juice!"
Danielle van Manen,5.0,2 months ago,"We had an amazing time here. We booked tickets to the top via Gambi tours and our host Kenny was lovely. She shared much information, paid close attention to her guests and was very friendly. Knowledgeable but also funny and lighthearted.

I have visited the Eiffel Tower before but this was the first time to the top and to me it was worth it. Thanks to our tickets it all went super fast and we had plenty of time to walk around and take in the views. Buy tickets beforehand, especially if you want to go to the top.

I also very much recommend to watch the light show in the evening. Every full hour when it’s dark. Watch your stuff, lots of pickpockets active in this area"
Ümit Tekin,4.0,2 weeks ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower and seeing the view from the top is amazing; the Paris skyline is truly impressive. However, the area around the tower is very crowded, and the street vendors can be annoying. Some are quite pushy, which can make the area feel less safe. For a calmer photo, it’s better to take pictures from nearby neighborhoods or Trocadéro. Watching the lights blink in the evening is beautiful, but you need to be careful of the silly or disruptive people around.
Don’t get your caricature drawn — it’s overpriced and won’t really look like you! 😅"
betty eshete,5.0,4 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is truly a must-visit landmark in Paris. I highly recommend going to the top floor in the evening, where the panoramic view of the entire city is simply breathtaking. Exploring this iconic piece of history is an unforgettable experience. During my 15-day stay in Paris, I visited four times — and each visit felt just as remarkable as the first. It’s an attraction that never loses its charm."
Fantasy x Maps,5.0,a month ago,"Surprisingly, I was able to book a summit ticket a day in advance. The lines were long for both ticket and non-ticket holders, so I would advise to try and plan a day that won't rain and/or is not windy.

I got a 6:30pm ticket time slot and went to the ticket holder line around 6:15pm. Though, one of the lifts got stuck at the 2nd floor, so we waited almost an hour for instructions and our line was later guided to another working lift. After that, I went to the top and luckily, there were no strong winds, so I was able to enjoy the experience without worrying about my hands freezing.

A must go experience if you havent visited Paris before ~"
thagishu tharau,5.0,2 weeks ago,"I did not go inside the towere. Its beautiful at night,  the sparkling light shower lasts minutes beginning of every hour. The vendors try to take your ""professional"" photo shoot are a bit of nagging tbh!"
Jan Kalbantner,5.0,Edited 5 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is an iconic Paris landmark, built in 1889 for the World’s Fair and standing 330 meters tall with stunning iron lattice design. As a must-visit, it offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city from its three levels—first at 57m, second at 115m, and summit at 276m. The experience is magical, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour until 1am.
History buffs will love knowing it was designed by Gustave Eiffel and features a secret apartment at the top. For visitors, book tickets online up to 60 days in advance to skip long queues—summit access via elevator costs €35.30 for adults in 2025, €17.70 for youth (12-24), and €8.90 for kids (4-11), with free entry under 4. Opening hours are typically 9:30am to 11:45pm, extending to midnight in summer; last entry 45 minutes before closing.
Arrive early to avoid crowds, and consider the stairs for a cheaper option (€14.20 to second floor for adults). The second floor has shops, restrooms, and the best views without needing the summit. Security checks are thorough, so pack light. Nearby, enjoy the Champ de Mars gardens for picnics or photos. Pro tip: Visit on weekdays like Wednesday for fewer people, and pair with a Seine River cruise for a full experience. It’s crowded but unforgettable—definitely worth the hype!"
Gabriel Salinas,5.0,a month ago,"You dont need anything to appreciate the beauty of pure history, its an icon or all the world, recomend to visit. I viaited it during Olympic Games 2024 and it was pretty clean and amazing."
Mahesh Kara,5.0,a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower, an iconic Paris landmark, stands 330 meters tall with stunning views from its three levels. Built for the 1889 World’s Fair, it symbolizes French culture and innovation. Its sparkling nightly lights create a magical atmosphere, making it a must-visit monument for millions worldwide."
Hunter,5.0,2 weeks ago,"A must see in Paris!

I recommend going in December when there are less tourist and you’re able to see more. I’ve been to the top 3 times and it never gets old. If you want a challenge, try taking the stairs. It’s not as bad as you think and you’re able to take in the views from every step.  The ticket is cheaper and you’re able to use the elevator once you reach the second level.

Note - There is security to enter the area under the Eiffel Tower, so you will need to pass through it to access the ticket office and lines to go up. I recommend giving yourself a little extra time because you never know how long the lines might be once arriving."
Bel,5.0,4 months ago,"An unforgettable experience!
The Eiffel Tower is absolutely breathtaking —a true icon of Paris. From the ground, it's stunning, but the view from the top is even more magical, especially at sunset. Everything was well organized, and the light show at night was the perfect ending. A must-visit for anyone traveling to Paris! 😉😊🗼"
Patrizia Iginia Palazzini,5.0,a month ago,"An iconic landmark that never loses its magic, no matter how many times you see it. The Eiffel Tower is simply breathtaking up close: the ironwork, the scale, and the open structure make it one of the most recognizable monuments in the world.

Whether you admire it from the Champ de Mars, the Trocadéro terraces, or from underneath its massive arches, the tower has a unique presence that makes every angle spectacular.

A bit of history & curiosities:
•	The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.

•	Designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel, it was initially criticized by many artists and writers who considered it an eyesore.

•	At 330 meters tall today, it was the world’s tallest structure for over 40 years.

•	It was almost dismantled in the early 1900s, but its usefulness as a radio transmission tower saved it.

•	Millions of visitors come each year, and its nightly sparkle—created by 20,000 lights—is now one of Paris’s most iconic moments.

Climbing or visiting the tower is worth it for the views alone: Paris stretches out in every direction, from the Seine to Montmartre and the Louvre.

A must-see, timeless symbol of Paris—beautiful by day, unforgettable at night."
John Linuel Tenido,5.0,a month ago,"Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time was absolutely breathtaking! The structure is even more stunning in person than in photos. The atmosphere around it is full of life and excitement, and it truly feels magical especially when it lights up at night."
Dr P J George,5.0,2 months ago,"One of the most visited wonders of the world. Had heard of it for years and had a conception of it as a marvellous tower, but the real tower far exceeded all my expectations. Eiffel Tower is unique and spectacular for a number of reasons: its unique structure, its massive size, its perfect symmetry, visibility from far-away places, dazzling illumination at night, and the number of visitors every year. The compound has ll the facilities tourists require. It is always advisable to visit it at least twice a day, once during morning and then during late evening."
Adela Battelli,5.0,2 months ago,"No matter how many photos you’ve seen, nothing compares to seeing the Eiffel Tower in person. Standing beneath it is awe-inspiring — the sheer scale and elegance of the structure are incredible.
We booked our tickets online in advance (highly recommended to skip the long queues), and the process was smooth. The elevators are efficient, and the staff are helpful and friendly. We went up just before sunset, which was absolutely magical — watching the city lights slowly come to life from the top was unforgettable. The view from the summit offers a full panorama of Paris. The sparkling light show every evening on the hour is pure joy — it draws a crowd but is worth every moment. There are cafés and souvenir shops on the first and second levels, though prices are a bit high (as expected for such an iconic landmark).
Getting there is easy via Métro Line 6 (Bir-Hakeim) or RER C (Champ de Mars–Tour Eiffel), and the surrounding Champ de Mars gardens are perfect for photos or a picnic afterward. Tip: Go early morning or late evening to avoid crowds — and bring a jacket if you’re going to the summit; it can get windy!"
Akseniya Veleva-Buzova,4.0,a month ago,Beautiful place with beautiful views but much crowded and waiting at the elevators. You need to have at least 3 hours to see the views and you may stay as much hours as you want and you may also drink and eat with a view.
Jamie Higgs-Dey,5.0,2 months ago,"How could this not be 5*?! The iconic tower is really a sight to behold, we had pre-booked tickets so we whisked through the already super short queue. Even thought the elevators to get up to the top seem to take a long time it does pass by quick. The number of photo opportunities from the foot of the tower to the tip are countless. All the staff that we interacted with were friendly. The upper areas get very crowded and tight but it’s still comfortable to move around. Dress warm in the cooler months as the wind can get a little brisk. Be sure to see it during the even, especially the sparkle each hour."
Anne Chin,5.0,2 months ago,"Driving through the view of the majestic Eiffel Tower during the day and night was something of a better admiration of the city of Paris. Albeit the traffic. The lights, the happy people walking along the streets of Paris admiring the area makes one feel that life is worth it. We parked nearby. For free! A short walk to the Eiffel Tower. First went at night. Been here twice and Night time view of the Eiffel is for me better than day view. It is i can say more romantic at night."
BA,5.0,3 months ago,"Something I’ve always hoped to experience.
No matter how hyped the Eiffel Tower is, seeing it in person was truly unforgettable. I had only seen it in books before, so experiencing it up close felt surreal—like a dream realized. It does get very crowded, so I recommend visiting early in the morning and on weekdays if possible.

I took a bus from the Opera area and then walked to the tower, which I enjoyed so much. I spent time taking photos and videos, soaking it all in, and then wandered through the nearby park and surrounding cafés. It was such a joyful, memorable experience.

At night, the tower is even more magical when it lights up—absolutely worth seeing both during the day and after dark. A must-visit in Paris!"
Renuka Morris,5.0,2 months ago,It’s as romantic as it gets even after several visits. There’s a charm about The Eiffel Tower. You don’t need tickets to view the gardens and its surroundings. Plenty of photo opportunities. I like taking the public transport to Rue de Mars. You get to the foot of the tower.
Orly Heiblum,5.0,2 months ago,"We went up to the top floor, totally worth it. We went on a Sunday at 15h00 with 2 kids under 5, and ir was wonderful. A lot of people but nothing crazy. Not a lot of waiting time (only around 15 minutes for two of the elevators). Super windy! Take a jacket and a winger hat if possible. We were able tôt ake the stroller up, just folded."
Gopala krishnan Vellingiri (VGK),5.0,Edited 3 months ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower for the first time was truly one of the most magical moments of my life. Standing before this iconic structure, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and excitement. At night, when the tower sparkles, it’s simply breathtaking—an elegant masterpiece glowing against the Paris sky.

The atmosphere around the Eiffel Tower is filled with energy, with tourists from all over the world gathering to admire its beauty. What makes it even more special is that you can view it from different spots in the city, and each view feels unique.

Going up to the summit was an unforgettable experience—the panoramic view of Paris from the top left me speechless. Seeing the city’s lights stretch endlessly was both romantic and deeply emotional, making me feel grateful and so alive in that moment.

The Eiffel Tower is not just a structure; it’s a symbol of love, elegance, and brilliance. My heart was filled with happiness during my visit, and the memory will stay with me forever. ❤️"
Shashidhar Mishra,5.0,a month ago,"I recently visited the Eiffel Tower, and honestly, it felt surreal seeing it in person after viewing it in pictures my whole life. The atmosphere around the tower is lively, with people from all over the world taking photos, laughing, and just soaking in the moment. The view from the top was absolutely worth the wait — the entire city of Paris looks magical from up there, especially around sunset. I also enjoyed the little cafés nearby where you can relax and enjoy the vibe. Overall, it’s one of those places that really lives up to the hype, and I’d definitely recommend visiting if you ever get the chance."
KHALED BIN BISHR,5.0,2 weeks ago,"The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous landmarks in the world and a symbol of Paris.

Porter Charles,4.0,2 months ago,"Licensing get in was fast, security xrays your stuff. No reservations needed. The whole area is closed off to vendors and the like so it felt pretty safe from scammed and pick pockets.

Tickets to go up are expensive, a restaurant at the mid level has average prices.

Only one food stall menu but two stalls in the enclosed area, they didnt look good.

Gift shop was ok, could have been better.

There was nothing to explain what you were seeing, no history mentioned etc. Not a museum just a landmark.

Many street vendors bombarding you outside the grounds.

There is a toilet on site but be prepared to wait 30mins or more and pay as is usual in paris.

Beautiful grounds and a few places to take your picture, but best pics for you to be in them are outside the grounds."
Hartono Halim,5.0,2 months ago,"The view was breathtaking and there was a nice 3D photo booth souvenir shop. However, we had to wait 30 mins in the cold to take the lift going down with no idea when the lift was going to come. Overall, it was a fantastic experience to visit the effiel tower."
brent backman,5.0,3 months ago,Have been during the day as well as at night.  At night is by far the best.  Went all the way to the top and is amazing at night.  Took less than 35 minutes from the point she scanned our tickets to us being back down.  Went about 9pm.
Chandeboy Maglinte,5.0,Edited a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower — the one landmark that makes you stop and realize you’re truly in Paris. Watching it rise above the city, surrounded by laughter, music, and that unmistakable Parisian charm, feels surreal. From sunrise to sparkle hour, every angle tells a different story. Grateful for this moment, for this city, and for memories that shine just as bright."
Shishira Navneeth,5.0,3 weeks ago,"Much better seen at night!
Dancing lights between 18:00 and 18:05. Don’t miss. Free to see from outside and inside. Need to buy ticket only if you want to go on top."
Peter Wan,4.0,a month ago,"There are many different angles to view the Eiffel Tower from. The monument was alot bigger than than what I'd imagined. It's just a great place to relax and enjoy especially during the evening.

The Eiffel tower lights will sparkle every 1 hour starting from sunset. There are many good locations to watch especially rooftops etc.

The location is also towards to city center near other locations which makes it perfect as a stop near other tourist locations.

You can also go up the Eiffel Tower to the observation deck but that requires tickets. You can find other areas like the Montmontre or any other free rooftops instead of the Eiffel tower observatory deck as free alternatives instead. It also tends to look better from further distances compared to up close."
Josue Villamar,5.0,3 months ago,Just like I imagined it to be. Magnificent and a wonder of architecture. Very nice time there. Make sure to get your tickets prior to the visit. You can buy champagne and caviar at the summit. The visit to the summit is totally worth it so I highly recommend it :)
Muhammed Ahmed,4.0,Edited 3 weeks ago,"The place is one of the icons on earth worth to be seen at least.
Architecture design is fantastic but prepare your self for crowds everywhere. You might take some time to pick the right spot for the perfect photo. I recommend the other bank of the river."
Pennie Shaw,5.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is a gorgeously constructed place. A ride to the top to see the view of the city is a must. Even on a gloomy day it was fabulous. What a great feat of engineering. Gold at night and diamond flashes on the hour.
Do not sit on the ground....rats!"
Mark Hoogs,5.0,2 months ago,"Everyone knows this is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. A couple of quick pieces of advice - it's amazing to see at night when it's lit up, especially the first 5 minutes of each hour when the lights sparkle; and watch out for scammers around the bottom - there are lots of street vendors trying to hustle their trinkets, but also some scammers lurking around trying to trick you into whatever fraud they're playing that day. Just don't engage - don't get involved in ""negotiating"" with the street vendors, don't get tricked into the ""I bought extras and want to give you something for free"" scam, etc. If you want souvenirs, you're better off just going to an actual shop."
Purple Armadillo,5.0,4 months ago,"One of the world's greatest landmarks set on the edge of the river Seine and surrounded by beautiful parkland. We were there on a sunny August day. The park was filled with happy families. The queues were long and we didn't pay to go in but just being there, seeing it in real life and soaking up the atmosphere was great. We also had fun using the free rotating door toilets in the park that self clean after each use!"
Shannon Neenan,5.0,2 months ago,"This is one of the most iconic landmarks of Pairs. A visit here is a must if you are in  Paris. We climbed the stairs to the second floor.  That was a great view across paris, in fact a 360 degree view all across Paris!  If your a little less able there is a lift that can be caught from the bottom right to the top or stop at the second floor. It's not a bad walk up if you take it easy.  I walked up with my kids aged 7, 11 and 13 and all found it easy.  There are food outlets and toilets on the 1st and second floors, I dont know what's on the top floor as I didnt go, but i'd presume that there is on the top floor too."
Khalil Awad,3.0,5 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is without doubt one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Visiting it feels like ticking off a major box on any travel bucket list. The structure is breathtaking, especially when seen up close. Whether you’re admiring it from the ground or going all the way up, there’s a certain magic to it — especially around sunset or when it lights up in the evening. The view from the top offers a panoramic look over the whole of Paris, and it’s something that sticks with you.

That said, while I was impressed by the tower itself, I can’t say the same about Paris as a whole. The city just didn’t connect with me personally. It felt a bit too crowded, too busy, and honestly, a bit overrated. I found it lacked the warmth or charm I’ve experienced in other cities. But that’s a personal opinion, and I know many people love it here.

If you’re visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower is definitely worth the visit — even if the rest of the city doesn’t win you over. It’s a symbol of France for a reason, and standing beneath it is an unforgettable experience."
Owais Mengal,5.0,a month ago,"Shocking Facts about Eiffel Tower 🗼

The Eiffel Tower stands tall as one of the world’s most iconic landmarks, but its backstory hits different once you dive into the details. Visiting it feels like stepping into a legacy where tradition and innovation shake hands. The structure itself was completed in 1889 for the Paris World’s Fair, originally meant to be a temporary installation. Wild, right? Something that was supposed to survive just 20 years ended up becoming the heartbeat of Paris and a symbol recognized across the globe.

What truly shocks most people is that Parisians initially hated it. Critics called it an eyesore, but time has a funny way of proving people wrong. Today, the tower pulls in millions of visitors every year, standing as a masterclass in engineering and vision. Built from over 18,000 iron pieces and held together by more than 2.5 million rivets, the tower shows what human ambition can do when we play the long game.

One of the craziest facts is that the Eiffel Tower actually grows and shrinks. Because of temperature changes, it can increase in height by up to 15 centimeters—basically the OG “dynamic structure” before it was cool. And let’s not forget the secret apartment at the top where Gustave Eiffel himself used to chill with VIP guests.

If you're planning a trip, visiting at night hits different—the entire structure glows with a golden sparkle every hour. It’s not just a monument; it’s a vibe, a legacy, and a reminder that great things often come from bold ideas people once misunderstood"
Mohammed Nihal,5.0,a month ago,"The Eiffel Tower wasn’t busy at all when we went, which made the whole visit much better. It was a bit chilly, but the experience was still amazing. The sparkling lights are something you simply shouldn’t miss — truly the highlight of the night."
Violet Dunn,4.0,3 weeks ago,THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!!! The lights and the dark sky looked so amazing together. The crowd is very big though and you might get pushed around a bit. I walked around the city and got multiple views of it. Best is if u go see the sparkles at night!!!
Shikha Yadav,5.0,a month ago,"I travelled from abroad and finally saw the Eiffel Tower — and it felt like a dream come true. ✨ The lights, the view, the whole atmosphere is breathtaking. Paris truly knows how to steal your heart. ❤️

I visited the Eiffel Tower today and the experience was absolutely magical! I came all the way from abroad and it was totally worth it. The view from the top is breathtaking, especially during the evening when the city lights up. The sparkling lights on the tower every hour look stunning.

The area is very well-organized, the staff were helpful, and I felt very safe throughout my visit. It truly feels like a dream to finally see this iconic landmark in real life. If you’re visiting Paris, this is a must-see! ❤️✨
Thankyou Paris want to come again"
Jignesh Lad,5.0,4 months ago,"Busy as we went during the summer holidays but nice area to relax with a picnic.

Just be careful as there is a lot of folks walking around to pick pocket and also pester tourists.

Lovely views when near by and just impressive to visit."
Only Loafers,5.0,4 months ago,"Must visit when in Paris! Definitely get the tickets online beforehand! Lines move quick usually as the entrances are time slotted. Amazing views from the too. Amazed at the size of the elevators! If able to, it's worth coming down through the stairs!"
Tony Chien,5.0,3 months ago,It is a beautiful landmark that everyone needs to see when visiting Paris. It is not only stunning in the daytime but it also sparkles at night.  It is easily accessible through the subway.  We didn't get ticket to the top. It was still beautiful when we walked around the tower. You can also buy different tours in advance for accessing to the Eiffel Tower.
Rebbecca Cameron-Clarke,4.0,2 months ago,"Pretty standard for the tourist experience, free entry for the bottom - you do need to pass through security which should be fine tbh, it was really quick entry for sunset time too.

There’s a nice pond at the bottom as well as some merch stands and food carts. Decently priced merch - food was kind of meh. Watch out for the ducks! They will run up for some food (please don’t feed them any of the food it is not suitable for them and will make them ill)!

Really wish they did student discounts on entry for accessing the levels again, as they got rid of this 2019."
Hassan Basri Sathik,5.0,3 months ago,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

An absolutely breathtaking experience! The Eiffel Tower is truly iconic, and seeing it in person is even more magical than in pictures. The views from the top are spectacular – Paris stretches endlessly in every direction, and the city lights at night are unforgettable. The entire visit was well organized, with clear directions and smooth crowd management.

Whether during the day for panoramic city views or at night when the tower sparkles every hour, it’s a must-visit landmark. A perfect blend of history, architecture, and romance – no trip to Paris is complete without it."
Suzy,5.0,3 months ago,"Eiffel Tower is truly one of a kind! You can take amazing photos from any angle. If you plan to go up, make sure to book your ticket in advance — it’s absolutely worth it to see the whole of Paris from above and enjoy a glass of champagne while taking in the view 🥂✨Even with a ticket it takes 30mins to enter and exit."
Richard Lowe,5.0,2 months ago,"Iconic, Breathtaking, and Absolutely Worth It!
​No trip to Paris is complete without visiting the Eiffel Tower. Seeing it in person is just magical, and the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. It's truly an architectural marvel. It can get busy, so booking tickets in advance is a good idea.
​Photo Tip: For the best, classic photos of the Eiffel Tower, walk across the river to the Trocadéro Gardens. If you go up the hill and stand on the plaza, you'll get that perfect, unobstructed shot with the fountains in the foreground. It's especially beautiful at sunset or when the tower sparkles at night!"
Connie Redgrave,5.0,a month ago,"Stunning views all over Paris, would recommend an evening trip, as you can see all the lights in the streets of Paris and makes it more magical! That and it also being around Christmas added to the vibe"
Martina Miklošić,5.0,4 weeks ago,"Visiting the Eiffel Tower was absolutely worth it! The view of Paris from the top is breathtaking, especially in the evening when the city lights up. I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance to avoid long lines, and if possible, visit during the week when it’s less crowded. Watching the city from up there was one of the best experiences of my trip — truly unforgettable!"
Abby Latham,5.0,2 months ago,"Such a wonderful experience, we walked all the way to the second floor, it was a work out!! I would highly recommend bringing your own water! I would also recommend buying tickets in advance, we came in October around the slower season and the line for buying tickets was so long. Definitely glad to have bought the tickets in advance!"
Anna Kuksenko,5.0,4 months ago,"Great experience. Ordered tickets in advance for night time, elevator second floor. And purchased on site for Elevator top (we came to see sunrise near the tower, which was totally worth it. Then lowly walked towards the line up entrance, and were almost the first).
Best experience - day time. Getting up to the top worth it.
Night time - great to see how it glows.

Unless you are ready to wake up very early, recommending to buy tickets in advance."
Kareem A,5.0,4 months ago,"5/5 ⭐ – Eiffel Tower
An absolute must-see in Paris and even more impressive in person than in photos. The structure is massive, with incredible views from every level. Going up at sunset is highly recommended as you can watch the city light up while still seeing it in daylight. The tower sparkles every hour at night, which is a highlight of the visit and creates a great atmosphere along the Seine. Security and entry lines are well-organized, though still busy, so booking tickets in advance saves time. The surrounding Champ de Mars park is clean, spacious, and perfect for photos or a picnic. A world-class landmark that fully lives up to its reputation."
Nurana Nuriyeva,5.0,a month ago,"Every hour, the Eiffel Tower sparkles for 5 minutes, so you only have a short window to catch it. I heard that at 1:00 AM it sparkles for 10 minutes, but I’m not completely sure.
On national occasions, the Tower lights up in the colors of the French flag, which looks incredibly beautiful and unique."
karl briggs,5.0,a month ago,"I didn't go inside, I walked around it.

At night time the tower sparkles every hour for five minutes.

Go at night time to skip the queues.

The shops/restaurants around the tower are really expensive, I was lucky to go when there was a xmas market stall, which was more reasonable.

Lots of street vendors selling food/souvenirs, they will barter with you and your able to get a good deal with them."
Margarita Shevchuk,4.0,2 months ago,"The Eiffel Tower is as beautiful as always! The new security fence around it feels a bit sad — I still remember when you could freely stroll from Trocadéro all the way to Les Invalides. I understand the safety concerns, but it’s a reminder of how much the world has changed. Still, it remains one of the most breathtaking places to experience in person. 🌍"
J Youde,5.0,3 months ago,"Absolutely fantastic experience visiting this place. We experienced it first by walking along the Seine River where the views were amazing. We decided to go to the very top off the Eiffel Tower after dusk, when the Tower was lit up, in all its glory and to experience the sparkling of the lights. Also we wanted to see all of Paris lit up from the very top - which was such a magnificent experience. The whole Eiffel Tower evening experience was awesome and it was the highlight of our time in Paris."
