Even though it was a busy day, the entire area around the Eiffel Tower felt surprisingly relaxed and easy to navigate. The atmosphere is magic — standing underneath the structure and looking straight up is something photos never really prepare you for. The scale is unbelievable.\n\nI arrived early, and the queues moved quickly. Security was efficient and friendly, and the staff were helpful throughout. Once I got inside, the views from the different levels were incredible, especially from the top platform — Paris literally stretches out in every direction, with all the landmarks visible on a clear day.\n\nAt ground level, the park and riverside areas around the tower are perfect for photos. Everything is really well-maintained, and there’s plenty of space to sit, take in the view, and enjoy the moment. If you time it right, watching the tower sparkle on the hour is worth it alone.\n\nOverall, an unforgettable visit and absolutely worth doing, no matter how many times you’ve seen it in pictures. A real must-see."

From the moment you see it, the size and design are truly impressive. The structure looks stunning both during the day and at night, but the evening light show, when the tower sparkles every hour, is especially magical.\n\nThere are several viewing levels, each offering unique perspectives of Paris. The panoramic views from the top are absolutely breathtaking, allowing you to see famous landmarks like the Seine River, Sacré-Cœur, and the city’s beautiful rooftops. The elevators are well organized, and security is managed efficiently, though it can be busy, especially during peak tourist seasons.\n\nThe surrounding area is clean, spacious, and ideal for walking, picnics, and photography. Nearby cafés, souvenir shops, and river cruises make it easy to spend several hours in the area. Whether you choose to go up the tower or simply admire it from below, the Eiffel Tower delivers a memorable experience. It is a must-visit attraction for anyone traveling to Paris"

It’s huge, but somehow not heavy or overwhelming.\n\nThe area around it is relaxed. People sit around, talk, take photos, or just chill on the grass. Walking around the tower is nice because every angle looks a bit different, so you don’t feel rushed to leave after one picture.\n\nI went close to sunset and that was the best choice. The view from above is simple but beautiful — rooftops, long streets, and the city stretching out in every direction. Nothing fancy, just very Paris.\n\nAt night, when the tower starts sparkling, it hits differently. It’s crowded, yes, but for a few minutes everyone just stops and looks. That moment alone makes the visit worth it.\n\nNot a hidden gem, not a quiet place, but still something you should see at least once."

These spots are highlighted in photographer guides as “hidden” or less-crowded alternatives.  ￼\n•\tFlexible timing: Because you’re not tied to a ticket time, you can go early morning, late evening, or at twilight to capture different lighting and mood.\n•\tLower cost: Skipping entrance means saving time and money, and focusing instead on the view and atmosphere.\n•\tGreat for casual or photographic visits: If your priority is the Tower in your photo, rather than ascending it, this approach works perfectly.\n\n⸻\n\n⚠️ What to keep in mind\n•\tYou miss the “inside” experience: You won’t go up into the tower, see its internal architecture, or get panoramic views from heights—it’s purely an “outside vantage” experience.\n•\tCrowds/lines possible at popular spots: Even external photo spots can be crowded (especially the very popular ones like Trocadéro or Rue de l’Université). Some guides warn of “many people” even at street viewpoints.  ￼\n•\tLighting & viewpoint selection matter: Good photos depend heavily on time of day, weather, background composition (street, river, buildings). If you go at the wrong time you may get harsh light or less dramatic angle.\n•\tExpect standard viewpoint, not “secret”: Many external spots now appear in photo-spot guides and social media; so while you’re not entering the tower, you might share the view with others.\n•\tStill some cost/time: If you go out for the trip, you’ll still invest time (walking, transport) to reach a good baseline vantage."

The structure itself is even more impressive in person — both elegant and powerful — and the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. You can see all of Paris laid out beneath you, which really gives you a sense of how beautiful the city is.\n\nThe area around the tower felt very clean, safe, and well organized. We had heard stories in the past about street sellers and pickpocketing, but during our visit, everything seemed to be well controlled with a strong police presence. It made the whole experience much more relaxed and enjoyable for our family.\n\nOverall, it was one of the best parts of our trip. Whether it’s your first time in Paris or a return visit, the Eiffel Tower is truly worth it for both the history and the view."

Even on a cloudy day, the structure itself is breathtaking from the base. The sheer scale and engineering are incredible, making it a truly iconic landmark.\n​The Experience: We took the time to go up to one of the platforms, which I highly recommend. The views of Paris are spectacular, giving you a completely different perspective of the city. Being inside the lattice work of the tower itself is an experience. I especially appreciated the historical information available on the different levels, detailing its construction and use for early radio transmissions. It adds so much context to this magnificent monument.\n​Tips for Visitors:\n​Book Tickets in Advance: Lines can be very long, so pre-booking is essential to save time.\n​Allow Plenty of Time: There are security checks, queues for the lifts, and plenty of things to see once you're up there, so don't rush the experience.\n​Photo Ops: The viewing platforms offer incredible spots for family photos, framed by the beautiful ironwork and the city below.\n​Overall, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see landmark that lives up to its reputation. Highly recommended for all visitors to Paris!"

I recommend going around sunset so you can enjoy both the daylight view and the beautiful sparkling lights that start after dark (every hour on the hour).\n\nThe area is easy to access by metro—Trocadéro and Bir-Hakeim stations are the most convenient. From Trocadéro, you get one of the best vantage points for photos. Security checks are smooth, and the walking paths around the tower are well-organized for families and tourists.\n\nIf you want to go up, it’s best to book tickets online in advance to avoid the long lines. There are elevators for all levels, and stairs are available if you enjoy a bit of a workout. The Champ de Mars behind the tower is perfect for relaxing, taking pictures, or having a picnic.\n\nOverall, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see landmark—beautiful, accessible, and unforgettable both during the day and at night."

From the moment I stepped onto the Champ de Mars, the Iron Lady’s latticework felt both grand and surprisingly graceful. The views from the top are breathtaking—Paris stretches out in every direction like a living postcard, with the Seine curving through the city and landmarks popping up everywhere you look.\n\nThe experience felt smooth and well-organized. Staff were friendly, and even with the crowds, the lines moved faster than I expected. I loved taking my time on each level—there’s something special about pausing with a coffee and just soaking in the panorama. As evening fell, the tower’s sparkle made the whole scene feel downright romantic and cinematic.\n\nIf you’re planning a visit, I’d recommend booking tickets ahead of time and going a bit before sunset so you catch daylight, golden hour, and the first twinkle after dark. Whether you take the elevator or brave the stairs, the journey itself is part of the fun.\n\nAll in all, today’s visit was unforgettable. The Eiffel Tower isn’t just a must-see—it’s a must-feel. Five stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Today it’s one of the most visited places in the world, and when you stand under it, you understand why. Its also a symbol or France.\nInside, the tower has three main levels you can explore. On the first floor, there are displays that explain how the tower was built, a café, and sections of glass floor where you can look straight down to the ground. It feels a bit strange at first, but it’s fun. The second floor is higher and has a great view of Paris: you can see the river, the rooftops, and many famous sights. There are also shops and places to grab something to eat.\nIf you go to the very top, the view is amazing. You can see the whole city stretching in every direction. There’s also a small room set up to show what the builder’s office once looked like. It’s a nice little detail that helps you imagine the tower’s early days.\nTicket prices depend on how you go up. The lift to the second floor is €23.10 for adults, and climbing the stairs is cheaper, €14.50. If you want to go all the way to the top by lift, it’s around €36.10. Children and young people pay less.\nOne of my favourite moments was seeing the tower at night. Every evening, once it gets dark, it lights up in a warm golden colour. For five minutes at the start of each hour, it sparkles with thousands of twinkling lights. Watching the tower glow against the night sky feels special, and it gives the whole area a really magical atmosphere.\nWisiting the Eiffel Tower is exciting and surprisingly relaxing once you’re up there. It’s a simple but unforgettable way to see Paris from above eith a glass of champagne in your hand."

Its scale and intricate design are even more impressive in person than in photos.\n​For the best experience, you should definitely view it from both sides: the gardens and the elevated stairs opposite. However, if you are visiting in winter, keep in mind that the grassy lawns of the Champ de Mars are often fenced off. This is a \"winter rest period\" from mid-October to mid-April to allow the grass to regenerate and prevent it from being trampled during the wetter months.\n​Even with the grass closed, you can still get incredible views and photos from the paved pathways and benches around the park's edges. After that, head across the river to the elevated stairs at Trocadéro. This vantage point remains open and offers that classic, postcard-perfect straight-on view that is perfect for photography."

We have spent a decent amount of time and different angles of the tower and each is truly beautiful and romantic. Just be mindful with your surroundings and you should be ok. Never felt worried or unsafe while visiting Paris, and we did a lot of walking tours and local neighbourhood visits that just show how beautiful Paris is!"

I was completely amazed by the incredible structure — the details, the engineering, and the sheer size left me wondering how such a masterpiece was built so many years ago. Hearing my elder daughter explain the history and the different phases of construction made the experience even more special. It felt like seeing the tower through her eyes, filled with curiosity and excitement.\n\nTravelling with kids actually made the visit even more enjoyable. Their energy, questions, and excitement added so much joy to the experience. Watching them admire the views from each level and learn new things created beautiful memories for all of us.\n\nStaying at a hotel nearby made everything even more convenient. We could walk to the Eiffel Tower easily and enjoy the surrounding areas without any rush or stress. The combination of easy access, stunning views, and the magical atmosphere made our visit truly perfect.\n\nA must-visit landmark that lives up to every expectation — breathtaking, educational, and unforgettable for the entire family."

The wait for the 1st lift was about 15 min from timed entry, the wait for the 2nd was over 30 min and it may get very windy on the open platform. I would plan for at least an hour on top, there are 2 levels on top, one enclosed and heated and it offers an amazing view from the open platform. Very rewarding to watch city dressing in the lights.\nNow, i found it best to buy tix 60 days in advance from official site, but it may be close to impossible to do outside of same time zone. You have to use VPN and hunt for desired time slot midnight sharp Paris time. You may have to also change local clock to Paris time on top. I would strongly recommend to \"test\" the site few days in advance to understand what to expect. Good luck, enjoy magnificent experience."

I recently had a photoshoot here, and the location is simply breathtaking.\n\nIt’s more than just a landmark; it's the heart of Paris. The architecture is stunning from every angle - whether you are shooting from Trocadéro for the classic view, or from the banks of the Seine, or even the charming side streets.\n\nYes, it can be crowded, but that is part of the vibrant atmosphere. The results are always worth it. The photos aren't just pictures; they are timeless memories filled with romance and Parisian charm. For any couple or individual wanting to capture the spirit of Paris, this is the location. I'm attaching a few photos from my session to show its beauty!"

No matter how many photos you’ve seen before, standing in front of it in person feels completely different. The scale, the details in the ironwork, and the way it dominates the Paris skyline are impressive in a way that’s hard to describe.\n\nGoing up the tower is absolutely worth it. The views over Paris are stunning, especially on a clear day. You get a full sense of how beautiful and elegant the city is, with the Seine winding through it and landmarks visible in every direction. Even just spending time at the base, walking around and taking photos, feels special.\n\nYes, it can get crowded, and lines can be long if you don’t plan ahead. Buying tickets in advance definitely helps. Security is well organized, and staff do their best to keep things moving smoothly despite the number of visitors.\n\nAt night, the experience becomes even more magical. When the tower lights up and sparkles, it creates one of the most memorable moments you can have in Paris. It’s romantic, iconic, and something you’ll remember long after your trip is over. A true must-see."

I’m still amazed that such a grand project was built back in 1889 and has been preserved so well to this day. As a historical monument, it’s nothing less than a masterpiece.\n\nThat said, I’d strongly recommend visiting in autumn or spring. We went in the summer, and the crowds were overwhelming – it makes the whole experience less enjoyable.\n\nWe didn’t go up the tower itself, as all our friends who had visited before advised us against it. They said it wasn’t worth the long queues and the ticket price. Honestly, we enjoyed the tower much more from the outside and from other viewpoints in the city.\n\nAnother downside is the aggressive street vendors around the tower. Every few steps you hear “buy this, buy that” — keychains, water bottles, T-shirts, photos. Honestly, it takes away from the magic of the place.\n\nBut despite this, the Eiffel Tower is one of those places you have to see at least once in your lifetime. Standing beneath it and realizing its history is truly unforgettable."

Designed as a well lit, airy, strong structure, which pioneered a revolution in civil engineering.\n\nIt remarkably stands on four lattice girder piers. The glass cage machines were designed by the US Otis Elevator Company, which later became the main feature of the building.\n\nThough, Modifications were made for further international expositions of 1900, 1925, and 1937 but Additions to the tower were made for television transmissions only wherein 66 feet were added to it's height.\n\nThe tower features a museum (which we were unable to see), restaurants, and a much talked about Eiffel’s Reception Room providing space for business conferences, cultural events, and social gatherings.\nAn observation deck is located just under the antenna, at 906 feet.\n\nProud to have actually been there to see it, feel the awesome greatness of this incredible fascinating structure and partaking a great view of the city.\n\nNaturally, a ticket needs to be bought as per one's time slot. There are lifts to take you up, some shops to let you browse and to buy souvenirs for back home give-aways."

Being able to linger, take photos, and simply soak in the atmosphere made the experience truly special.\n\nThe tower’s architecture is stunning up close, and from the observation decks, Paris feels alive, endless, and magical.

Seeing this iconic landmark in person with my wife and our 3-year-old son was an emotional and exciting experience. No matter how many times you’ve seen it in photos, standing in front of it is a whole different feeling—the sheer beauty and elegance of the tower are breathtaking.\n\nWe chose to go in the evening, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. As the sun began to set, the atmosphere around the Eiffel Tower became magical. The tower looked stunning against the glowing sky, and when it started to sparkle for 5 minutes at the beginning of each hour, it felt like the whole crowd paused to admire it. Watching those golden lights twinkle was a sight that truly gave us goosebumps.\n\nThe area was filled with a lively and joyful crowd—tourists, families, and couples all enjoying the moment together. We spent time sitting in the gardens nearby, where our little boy could run around while we relaxed and soaked in the atmosphere. From there, we had a perfect view of the tower as it lit up against the evening sky.\n\nIt was such a beautiful family moment—peaceful, yet filled with excitement from everyone around. The Eiffel Tower is not just a monument, but an experience. Sitting there together, watching it sparkle, made our first visit unforgettable and something we’ll treasure forever."

On the 2nd floor, there’s a coffee shop and a few small stores, great for a short break and souvenirs.\n\nAt the summit, you’ll find a champagne bar and a truly breathtaking view of Paris especially if you go close to sunset. The view alone makes the visit unforgettable.\n\nI’d highly recommend pre-booking your tickets online to save time. Take the lift to the summit first, then walk down each level to really enjoy everything the tower has to offer.

Built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle by engineer Gustave Eiffel, it was originally meant to be a temporary structure. Today, it stands as a global symbol of Paris and is one of the most visited monuments on earth.\n\nI booked tickets online to reach the top floor of the Eiffel Tower. Online booking is the only way to get tickets, and it is highly in demand on both weekdays and weekends. It is important to book in advance and arrive on time.\n\nAfter entering the premises, there is a security check to pass through. Depending on your ticket type, you can take the elevator or stairs to reach the second floor. From there, you get a beautiful view of the Paris skyline. If you have tickets for the top floor, you can continue by elevator or stairs to reach the summit.\n\nThere are no strict time limits once you reach the top. The top floor usually closes around 6 p.m. I recommend visiting close to sunset to enjoy the stunning views and unforgettable atmosphere.\n\nIf you are visiting Paris even once in your lifetime, this is a must see. I strongly suggest going to the top floor without worrying too much about the extra cost. It is absolutely worth it for the incredible experience.\n\nOverall, a memorable and breathtaking visit that should not be missed!"

        "Review Text": "Visiting the Eiffel Tower was, without exaggeration, one of the most memorable experiences of my stay in Paris. No matter how many photos you’ve seen before, nothing truly prepares you for the feeling of standing beneath it and looking up. The scale, the elegance, and the intricate iron structure create an overwhelming sense of awe. It’s not just a monument — it genuinely feels like the beating heart of the city.\nWhat impressed me most is how the tower changes depending on perspective. From a distance, it dominates the skyline with confidence and grace. Up close, the fine details of the ironwork become visible, revealing the extraordinary precision and craftsmanship behind the structure. Walking underneath the tower is an experience in itself — the sounds of the city mix with voices from all over the world, creating a vibrant, international atmosphere.\nThe visit is generally well organized, but it’s important to be prepared. If you want to reach the very top of the tower, you should expect several separate queues along the way. There isn’t just one line — there are multiple stages, and each queue can easily take between 10 and 20 minutes. This applies to ticket checks, elevators, and transitions between levels. While the waiting can feel long, the process is orderly and safe, and knowing this in advance helps manage expectations and avoid frustration.\nGoing up the tower is absolutely worth the time. The views from above are breathtaking. Paris opens up beneath you — the Seine winding through the city, classic rooftops stretching to the horizon, and famous landmarks visible in every direction. From this height, the city feels calm and harmonious, offering a completely new appreciation of its beauty and layout.\nThe experience becomes even more magical in the evening. Once the sun sets and the tower lights up, the atmosphere changes entirely. When it begins to sparkle, people naturally stop, smile, and look up together. It’s a shared moment of wonder that feels spontaneous and emotional, whether you’re visiting with someone or standing among strangers.\nThe surrounding area, especially the Champ de Mars, enhances the visit even more. It’s an ideal place to relax, take photos, or simply sit and admire the tower from different angles. The space feels open, lively, and welcoming at any time of day.\nOverall, the Eiffel Tower is far more than a tourist attraction you simply “tick off” a list. It’s a powerful, emotional experience — inspiring, humbling, and unforgettable. Despite the queues, the visit fully rewards your patience. It represents Paris in the most authentic way: elegant, historic, vibrant, and timeless. A true must-see that absolutely lives up to its legendary reputation."

We visited on sunday and we were still able to get them. The wait line was pretty much the same to go by lift or by stairs. Stairs are not scary or tough - I recommend it! We waited an hour to get on. October is probably not the peak of the season as it was not THAT crowded. You need a bit of patience though! But for a summit visit, you MUST book in advance. Loved the view and the architecture!"

They have a high-end restaurant. They have seeding for you just to sit and enjoy the view."

Don’t even waste your time trying to eat at the restaurant. The hostess is delightful, but the servers are obviously unhappy with their existence. I’m willing to pay the prices and these people don’t want to serve me? Come on! ALSO! Buy a drink at a restaurant and use the bathroom before heading there. The bathrooms there are outrageous! So many people, and if you speak English, overweight French people will yell at you! Girl I am just in line to use the bathroom! What did I do to you?😂 Just tell them you don’t understand and walk away🥰."

We even had champagne with our ticket, the views were amazing but did find getting up very chaotic. Long waits which wasn't as bad as on the way down due to 2 lifts out of 4 failing causing chaos to get down. Lucky for us we were at the front of the queue but it was still quite some time before we reached the bottom. Although this happened we would both still highly recommend doing this experience as this is an old structure from 1889 and we understand that is not always going to run as smooth as you expect."

To miss a visit to the Tower is to miss out.\nYou can go into the grounds for free but will need to go through security, and it will cost you to go up the Tower itself - but it is so very worth it.  You have the option to go halfway up or you can pay a little extra and go all the way to the very top, although expect to wait in line a while as the lifts to the very top are quite small and the queues are long.\nOnce you are at the top it's clear to see it was worth it. There are both indoor and outdoor viewing points, a very small champagne shop, and (thankfully) a toilet.\nMy words will never do it justice so I highly recommend paying a visit.\n\nGOOD 👍\nIt's an iconic landmark with amazing views.\n\nBAD 👎\nDoes get busy and isn't cheap.

Paris stretches out in every direction, and it’s worth every step of the climb. My young kids managed it easily, so don’t be put off, it’s very doable for families. The tickets are great value too! only €14.50 for adults and €7 for children. For such an iconic landmark, that’s fantastic!\n\nAt night, the Eiffel Tower transforms into something truly spectacular. Every hour, on the hour, it sparkles for five minutes, and the sight is unforgettable, like something out of a fairytale. Standing beneath it while it twinkles is one of those “wow” moments you’ll never forget.\n\nHighly recommend visiting both by day and night. It’s an absolute must when in Paris!"

Beyond being an iconic symbol of Paris, it represents a masterpiece of 19th-century engineering and design innovation. The use of exposed iron structure, precision in detailing, and elegance in proportions make it both a technical and aesthetic triumph. Standing beneath it, you can truly appreciate how revolutionary Gustave Eiffel’s vision was for its time. The panoramic views from the top are breathtaking, but equally impressive is observing the tower’s structure up close, it’s a lesson in structural clarity, material honesty, and timeless design. A must-see not just for tourists, but for anyone who appreciates architecture and engineering excellence."

Seeing this world-famous landmark in photos is one thing, but standing right beneath it is a completely different experience it genuinely takes your breath away. From the moment I arrived, I was amazed by its incredible architecture and the feeling of history and romance that surrounds the entire place.\n\nI visited in the late afternoon, and it was the perfect time. Watching the sunset over Paris from the top was magical the whole city slowly lit up as the golden light faded, and then suddenly, the tower began to sparkle with thousands of twinkling lights. The atmosphere was filled with excitement; people were cheering, taking photos, and simply admiring the view in silence.\n\nThe view from the top is something I’ll never forget. You can see all of Paris the Seine River winding through the city, the Louvre, Notre Dame, and the charming rooftops stretching out in every direction. The lift ride itself was smooth, and everything was well-organized. The staff were polite and helpful, guiding visitors kindly even though it was quite crowded.\n\nThere are small cafés and souvenir shops inside where you can grab a coffee or a light snack, which makes the experience even better. I also loved walking around Champs de Mars Park afterward it’s one of the best spots to take photos of the tower, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour.\n\nOverall, the Eiffel Tower truly lives up to its reputation. It’s not just a monument it’s a symbol of beauty, art, and human creativity. Whether you visit during the day or at night, it leaves you with a sense of wonder and appreciation for Paris. I would absolutely recommend every traveler to visit at least once in their lifetime."

From far away, the tower seems light and decorative, but up close it feels strong and precise. The iron “lace” is not decoration. It is the structure itself. Every curve and crisscross helps the tower stand tall against gravity and wind.\n\nGustave Eiffel designed the tower with wind in mind. As the tower rises, it becomes narrower because strong winds hit higher levels with more force. The curved shape lets wind pass around it instead of pushing straight against it. This design choice is why the tower has survived storms for more than a hundred years.\n\nOne of the most interesting features is that nothing is hidden. The iron beams, joints, and rivets are all visible. Over 18,000 iron pieces are held together by millions of rivets, allowing the tower to expand and contract as temperatures change. Even the elevators follow the curve of the legs instead of moving straight up. The Eiffel Tower proves that smart engineering can be beautiful without trying to be fancy."

I'd suggest you buy tickets in advance and consider going when it's raining or in the evening before closing time as there's much less people.  Be absolutely sure what type of ticket your purchasing and make sure you're buying the ticket from the official website.  Double check the ticket is for 1st, 2nd or Top floor access.  Don't walk up the stairs to the 2nd floor unless you're in good shape for 600+ outdoor stairs.  (Even walking down the stairs is taxing on the legs.)  We noticed the elevators were always completely filled, so watch your belongings and children.  There's limited seating under and around the Tower and very limited rain/weather cover so bring a jacket if the weather is a concern.  Also, the temperatures and wind on the top will be different from ground level.  Expect it to be cooler and windy.  And definitely use the restroom before you go up the Tower.  Be mindful of your surroundings and watch your valuables transiting to/from the Tower area.   And finally, taxis usually que up on the major roads surrounding the Tower."

You are told to get out and get in another line to go to the top. You are in a line with everyone else waiting to go up, no matter what time you were scheduled to go up.

Because it wasn’t a weekend, the area felt noticeably less crowded, which made everything calmer — more space to walk, easier to take photos, and a much more relaxed atmosphere overall.\n\nInstead of focusing only on going up the tower, we spent most of our time enjoying the surrounding area, and that turned out to be the best part for our family. Walking around the Champ de Mars and the nearby paths gave us so many beautiful angles of the tower without feeling rushed. We took our time, paused often for family photos, and just enjoyed the moment — watching the tower rise above the city while the Paris life moved around us.\n\nThe vibe on a weekday is also different: fewer tour groups, less noise, and it feels more like you’re seeing the Eiffel Tower as part of everyday Paris rather than a crowded tourist rush. We strolled, admired the views, and enjoyed the fresh air and the scenery, which made it feel like a proper Paris memory rather than a quick checklist stop.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit, I highly recommend going on a weekday and giving yourself time to explore the area around it. Even without rushing into a big itinerary, simply being there — walking, taking pictures, and soaking in the atmosphere — is already an unforgettable Paris experience."

Whether you see it glowing under the sun or shining beautifully under the moon, it completely pulls you in. During the day, this massive and intimidating tower rises higher than your eyes can follow and demands attention from every single angle (and trust me, it does not have a bad side). But at night, that is when the real magic hits. Covered in thousands of golden lights, it becomes absolutely hypnotizing. I was completely mesmerized standing under it after dark, and I couldn’t look away no matter how hard I tried. And forget the pictures and videos you’ve seen online because they don’t even come close. Do yourself a favor and go see it in person. You and the people you love deserve that experience. Honestly, even five stars feels like an insult because it is just that beautiful.\n\nI didn’t make it all the way to the top, and honestly, it didn’t matter. Just standing on the ground and looking up at it towering over me left me completely speechless. It makes you feel tiny and humbled but also inspired in a way that is hard to explain. The Eiffel Tower is not just something to check off a travel list, it is an experience you have to feel for yourself. Go see it, stand beneath it, and let it blow your mind because five stars will never be enough to describe how extraordinary it truly is."

It got a bit chilly in November, but the view was one to remember.\n\nWe took the elevator up but descended down the stairs for the experience. Was it worth it? Not quite sure. But it was very enjoyable overall."

It’s definitely worth going all the way to the top …though, I’ll admit, it’s not for the faint of heart. I don’t have a fear of heights, but even I felt a little uneasy up there at times! 😅 I went up during the day and came back at night and both experiences felt totally different. The view during the day is stunning but at night the lights on the tower are just magical. Highly recommend doing both if you can! It’s a must-see when you’re in Paris."

Yes, it will be crowded, and yes, it requires planning, but the experience is 100% worth it.\n\nThe experience is what you make it. You can simply admire its intricate ironwork from the Champ de Mars gardens with a picnic (a fantastic free option), or you can ascend to the top for breathtaking, unparalleled views of Paris.\n\nHere’s what to expect:\n\n· The Views: Absolutely spectacular. Seeing the city layout from above, with the River Seine winding through the streets and monuments like the Arc de Triomphe and Sacré-Cœur in the distance, is unforgettable. The second level offers the best balance for photos. The very top is a unique, thrilling experience, though the views are naturally more panoramic than detailed.\n· The Structure: Being on the tower itself is awe-inspiring. Looking down through the glass floors or just feeling the scale of the ironwork up close is incredible.\n· The Atmosphere: There's a palpable buzz of excitement from visitors from all over the world. It's especially magical at night when the tower sparkles for five minutes on the hour, every hour.\n\nA few tips for a better visit:\n\n· BOOK TICKETS ONLINE IN ADVANCE! This is the most important advice. Queues for tickets can be hours long. Pre-booking a timed slot saves an immense amount of time and stress.\n· Consider the stairs. If you're able, taking the stairs to the second floor is often faster, cheaper, and offers a unique, up-close perspective of the structure.\n· Go at different times: Sunset is a popular time for a reason – you get to see the city in daylight, at golden hour, and then lit up at night. But early morning can be less crowded.\n· Security check: There is a security check to enter the plaza, so expect a queue even with pre-booked tickets.\n\nAn essential Parisian experience. It’s busy, it's touristy, but it's also magnificent and unforgettable. Plan ahead, be patient, and prepare to be amazed.\n· Unforgettable, iconic views of Paris\n· Historic and engineering masterpiece\n· Magical atmosphere, especially at night\n· Different ticket options (stairs vs. elevator) to suit your budget"

You will get in the first lot.\nBuy the souvenirs from the shop under the tower, they are better quality.\nAvoid the food shops under the tower they are super expensive\nThe restaurants around the tower are tourist traps, they serve good food but again more expensive. If you want food with a view of the tower go for it\nBoat tour with dinner was a waste of time. Book the sunset tours without food. They are the best"

Seeing the iron lattice rise into the sky is one thing in photos, but standing beneath it and looking up at the structure that soars about 330 meters (roughly 1,083 feet) is an unforgettable sensation. The scale and engineering are phenomenal, and the views from the platforms are spectacular.\n\nThe area around the tower is just as charming. Classic Parisian buildings, broad promenades and the manicured lawns of the Champ de Mars give the whole spot a timeless, romantic feel. From the elegant Haussmann-era façades nearby to the vista across the Seine toward Trocadéro, the surrounding architecture makes wandering the neighborhood a joy — perfect for photos, relaxed strolls, and soaking in Parisian atmosphere.\n\nIt’s also a very popular place, so expect big crowds; people from all over the world gather here to admire the monument and take in the scenery. Because of that volume of visitors, be mindful of your belongings. Pickpockets operate in crowded tourist spots, and there are street hustles and game scammers who may try to distract you or pressure you into playing quick “games” that aren’t fair. Keep bags zipped and close, avoid carrying valuables in easily accessible pockets, and politely decline invitations from anyone hawking games or insisting you join impromptu activities.\n\nAll that said, the Eiffel Tower is a must-see — its sheer size and the beautiful historic surroundings make it an iconic Paris experience. With a little common-sense vigilance, you can fully enjoy one of the world’s most impressive landmarks."

The view rewards you with drama, and the crowds are fewer.\nAscent by mix of stairs and lifts.\nIt is typically very windy at the top, be prepared. And there can be long queues to get up there. Better out of summertime.\nEateries on the lower floors, but very expensive, though some more reasonable prices are in sandwich bars.\nSo, some of the best views of Paris, but when you look out, there’s no Eiffel Tower to see to remind you you’re in Paris. I think I prefer being on the outside looking in.\nEspecially, enjoy the view from the Trocadero at night. Much better."

From the top, you can choose to come back down either by stairs or by lift, so it’s really flexible depending on how you feel.\n\nThere was a short wait for the lift, it moved fairly quickly.

Gray skies? Très chic. Tower sparkling in the background? Oui, oui. The lawn was perfect for dramatic baby poses and for contemplating the deeper meaning of baguettes.\n\nCultural Immersion\nNothing says “I’ve embraced the spirit of France” like being under the Eiffel Tower while gripping a baguette half your size. Locals seemed impressed; tourists looked confused; pigeons feared me. All appropriate reactions to my vibe.\n\nComfort & Amenities\nI was held the entire time, which I found acceptable. Zero crawls were required.\n\nSnack Options\nMy baguette was artisanal, crunchy, and approximately the length of my torso. I recommend bringing your own baked goods unless you are prepared for the emotional impact of tasting bread this good for the first time.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nAs a baby of exquisite taste and an emerging authority on international landmarks, I give the Eiffel Tower 5 out of 5 baguettes.\n\nPerfect for photos, mustaches (real or otherwise), and cultivating a lifelong sense of European flair."

Some of the best views are actually outside the tower itself, and they’re completely free to access.\n\n---\n\n📸 Why You Don’t Need a Ticket\n\nNo ticket or queues: You can skip the long lines and elevator waits — just find a great vantage point and shoot freely at your own pace.\n\nFamous external photo spots: Excellent views from nearby streets include Rue de l’Université, Rue de Buenos-Aires, and Avenue de Camoëns — all well-loved by professional photographers and Instagram travelers.\n\nFlexible timing: Without a set ticket time, you can visit at sunrise, golden hour, twilight, or late night to capture the Tower under different moods and lighting.\n\nBudget-friendly: You save both money and time, focusing purely on the atmosphere and the view.\n\nPerfect for casual visitors or photographers: If your goal is the Eiffel Tower in your frame, not from its top, this approach is ideal.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind\n\nNo interior access: You’ll miss the inside structure and the panoramic city views from the top — this experience is purely from the outside.\n\nCrowds at popular spots: Iconic areas like Trocadéro and Rue de l’Université can get crowded, especially at sunset, so patience helps.\n\nLighting is key: For the best shots, plan your timing — morning light offers soft tones, while sunset provides warm golden hues.\n\nNot entirely “secret”: Many of these locations now appear in travel guides and social media, so expect other photographers too.\n\nPlan some time: You’ll still spend time walking or taking transport to reach the best angles, so schedule accordingly.\n\n---\n\n💡 Pro Tip\n\nFor the most unique and crowd-free shots, arrive just after sunrise or visit during the blue hour (after sunset) — the Eiffel Tower’s golden illumination against the evening sky is unforgettable."

The lines were long for both ticket and non-ticket holders, so I would advise to try and plan a day that won't rain and/or is not windy.\n\nI got a 6:30pm ticket time slot and went to the ticket holder line around 6:15pm. Though, one of the lifts got stuck at the 2nd floor, so we waited almost an hour for instructions and our line was later guided to another working lift. After that, I went to the top and luckily, there were no strong winds, so I was able to enjoy the experience without worrying about my hands freezing.\n\nA must go experience if you havent visited Paris before ~"

        "Review Text": "The Eiffel Tower is an iconic Paris landmark, built in 1889 for the World’s Fair and standing 330 meters tall with stunning iron lattice design. As a must-visit, it offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city from its three levels—first at 57m, second at 115m, and summit at 276m. The experience is magical, especially at night when it sparkles every hour on the hour until 1am.\nHistory buffs will love knowing it was designed by Gustave Eiffel and features a secret apartment at the top. For visitors, book tickets online up to 60 days in advance to skip long queues—summit access via elevator costs €35.30 for adults in 2025, €17.70 for youth (12-24), and €8.90 for kids (4-11), with free entry under 4. Opening hours are typically 9:30am to 11:45pm, extending to midnight in summer; last entry 45 minutes before closing.\nArrive early to avoid crowds, and consider the stairs for a cheaper option (€14.20 to second floor for adults). The second floor has shops, restrooms, and the best views without needing the summit. Security checks are thorough, so pack light. Nearby, enjoy the Champ de Mars gardens for picnics or photos. Pro tip: Visit on weekdays like Wednesday for fewer people, and pair with a Seine River cruise for a full experience. It’s crowded but unforgettable—definitely worth the hype!"

If you want a challenge, try taking the stairs. It’s not as bad as you think and you’re able to take in the views from every step.  The ticket is cheaper and you’re able to use the elevator once you reach the second level.\n\nNote - There is security to enter the area under the Eiffel Tower, so you will need to pass through it to access the ticket office and lines to go up. I recommend giving yourself a little extra time because you never know how long the lines might be once arriving."

The Eiffel Tower is simply breathtaking up close: the ironwork, the scale, and the open structure make it one of the most recognizable monuments in the world.\n\nWhether you admire it from the Champ de Mars, the Trocadéro terraces, or from underneath its massive arches, the tower has a unique presence that makes every angle spectacular.\n\nA bit of history & curiosities:\n•\tThe Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.\n\n•\tDesigned by engineer Gustave Eiffel, it was initially criticized by many artists and writers who considered it an eyesore.\n\n•\tAt 330 meters tall today, it was the world’s tallest structure for over 40 years.\n\n•\tIt was almost dismantled in the early 1900s, but its usefulness as a radio transmission tower saved it.\n\n•\tMillions of visitors come each year, and its nightly sparkle—created by 20,000 lights—is now one of Paris’s most iconic moments.\n\nClimbing or visiting the tower is worth it for the views alone: Paris stretches out in every direction, from the Seine to Montmartre and the Louvre.\n\nA must-see, timeless symbol of Paris—beautiful by day, unforgettable at night."

Standing beneath it is awe-inspiring — the sheer scale and elegance of the structure are incredible.\nWe booked our tickets online in advance (highly recommended to skip the long queues), and the process was smooth. The elevators are efficient, and the staff are helpful and friendly. We went up just before sunset, which was absolutely magical — watching the city lights slowly come to life from the top was unforgettable. The view from the summit offers a full panorama of Paris. The sparkling light show every evening on the hour is pure joy — it draws a crowd but is worth every moment. There are cafés and souvenir shops on the first and second levels, though prices are a bit high (as expected for such an iconic landmark).\nGetting there is easy via Métro Line 6 (Bir-Hakeim) or RER C (Champ de Mars–Tour Eiffel), and the surrounding Champ de Mars gardens are perfect for photos or a picnic afterward. Tip: Go early morning or late evening to avoid crowds — and bring a jacket if you’re going to the summit; it can get windy!"

There are many good locations to watch especially rooftops etc.\n\nThe location is also towards to city center near other locations which makes it perfect as a stop near other tourist locations.\n\nYou can also go up the Eiffel Tower to the observation deck but that requires tickets. You can find other areas like the Montmontre or any other free rooftops instead of the Eiffel tower observatory deck as free alternatives instead.

Just don't engage - don't get involved in \"negotiating\" with the street vendors, don't get tricked into the \"I bought extras and want to give you something for free\" scam, etc. If you want souvenirs, you're better off just going to an actual shop."

Visiting it feels like stepping into a legacy where tradition and innovation shake hands. The structure itself was completed in 1889 for the Paris World’s Fair, originally meant to be a temporary installation. Wild, right? Something that was supposed to survive just 20 years ended up becoming the heartbeat of Paris and a symbol recognized across the globe.\n\nWhat truly shocks most people is that Parisians initially hated it. Critics called it an eyesore, but time has a funny way of proving people wrong. Today, the tower pulls in millions of visitors every year, standing as a masterclass in engineering and vision. Built from over 18,000 iron pieces and held together by more than 2.5 million rivets, the tower shows what human ambition can do when we play the long game.\n\nOne of the craziest facts is that the Eiffel Tower actually grows and shrinks. Because of temperature changes, it can increase in height by up to 15 centimeters—basically the OG “dynamic structure” before it was cool. And let’s not forget the secret apartment at the top where Gustave Eiffel himself used to chill with VIP guests.\n\nIf you're planning a trip, visiting at night hits different—the entire structure glows with a golden sparkle every hour. It’s not just a monument; it’s a vibe, a legacy, and a reminder that great things often come from bold ideas people once misunderstood"

It is easily accessible through the subway.  We didn't get ticket to the top. It was still beautiful when we walked around the tower. You can also buy different tours in advance for accessing to the Eiffel Tower."

Decently priced merch - food was kind of meh. Watch out for the ducks! They will run up for some food (please don’t feed them any of the food it is not suitable for them and will make them ill)!\n\nReally wish they did student discounts on entry for accessing the levels again, as they got rid of this 2019."

The views from the top are spectacular – Paris stretches endlessly in every direction, and the city lights at night are unforgettable. The entire visit was well organized, with clear directions and smooth crowd management.\n\nWhether during the day for panoramic city views or at night when the tower sparkles every hour, it’s a must-visit landmark. A perfect blend of history, architecture, and romance – no trip to Paris is complete without it."

If you plan to go up, make sure to book your ticket in advance — it’s absolutely worth it to see the whole of Paris from above and enjoy a glass of champagne while taking in the view 🥂✨Even with a ticket it takes 30mins to enter and exit."

Seeing it in person is just magical, and the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. It's truly an architectural marvel. It can get busy, so booking tickets in advance is a good idea.\n​Photo Tip: For the best, classic photos of the Eiffel Tower, walk across the river to the Trocadéro Gardens. If you go up the hill and stand on the plaza, you'll get that perfect, unobstructed shot with the fountains in the foreground. It's especially beautiful at sunset or when the tower sparkles at night!"

I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance to avoid long lines, and if possible, visit during the week when it’s less crowded. Watching the city from up there was one of the best experiences of my trip — truly unforgettable!"

I would also recommend buying tickets in advance, we came in October around the slower season and the line for buying tickets was so long. Definitely glad to have bought the tickets in advance!"

And purchased on site for Elevator top (we came to see sunrise near the tower, which was totally worth it. Then lowly walked towards the line up entrance, and were almost the first).\nBest experience - day time. Getting up to the top worth it.\nNight time - great to see how it glows.\n\nUnless you are ready to wake up very early, recommending to buy tickets in advance."

Going up at sunset is highly recommended as you can watch the city light up while still seeing it in daylight. The tower sparkles every hour at night, which is a highlight of the visit and creates a great atmosphere along the Seine. Security and entry lines are well-organized, though still busy, so booking tickets in advance saves time. The surrounding Champ de Mars park is clean, spacious, and perfect for photos or a picnic. A world-class landmark that fully lives up to its reputation."

I heard that at 1:00 AM it sparkles for 10 minutes, but I’m not completely sure.\nOn national occasions, the Tower lights up in the colors of the French flag, which looks incredibly beautiful and unique."

The new security fence around it feels a bit sad — I still remember when you could freely stroll from Trocadéro all the way to Les Invalides. I understand the safety concerns, but it’s a reminder of how much the world has changed. Still, it remains one of the most breathtaking places to experience in person. 🌍"

We decided to go to the very top off the Eiffel Tower after dusk, when the Tower was lit up, in all its glory and to experience the sparkling of the lights. Also we wanted to see all of Paris lit up from the very top - which was such a magnificent experience. The whole Eiffel Tower evening experience was awesome and it was the highlight of our time in Paris."
